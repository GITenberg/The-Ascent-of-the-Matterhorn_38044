        <span style="font-size: 173%">PREFACE.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the year 1860,
        shortly before leaving England for a long continental tour, the late
        Mr. William Longman requested me to make for him some sketches of the
        great Alpine peaks. At this time I had only a literary acquaintance
        with mountaineering, and had even not seen—much less set foot upon—a
        mountain. Amongst the peaks which were upon my list was Mont Pelvoux,
        in Dauphiné. The sketches that were required of it were to celebrate
        the triumph of some Englishmen who intended to make its ascent. They
        came—they saw—but they did not conquer. By a mere chance I fell in
        with a very agreeable Frenchman who accompanied this party, and was
        pressed by him to return to the assault. In 1861 we did so, with my
        friend Macdonald—and we conquered. This was the origin of my
        scrambles amongst the Alps.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ascent of Mont
        Pelvoux (including the disagreeables) was a very delightful scramble.
        The mountain air did <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></span> act as an emetic; the sky did
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></span> look black, instead of blue;
        nor did I feel tempted to throw myself over precipices. I hastened to
        enlarge my experience, and went to the Matterhorn. I was urged
        towards Mont Pelvoux by those mysterious impulses which cause men to
        peer into the unknown. Not only was this mountain reputed to be the
        highest in France, and on that account was worthy of attention, but
        it was the dominating point of a most picturesque district of the
        greatest interest, which, to this day, remains almost unexplored! The
        Matterhorn attracted me simply by its grandeur. It was considered to
        be the most thoroughly inaccessible of all mountains, even by those
        who ought to have known better. Stimulated to make fresh exertions by
        one repulse after another, I returned, year <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>after year, as I had opportunity, more and more
        determined to find a way up it, or to <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prove</span></span> it
        to be really inaccessible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief part of
        this volume is occupied by the history of these attacks on the
        Matterhorn, and the other excursions that are described have all some
        connection, more or less remote, with that mountain or with Mont
        Pelvoux. All are new excursions (that is, excursions made for the
        first time), unless the contrary is pointed out. Some have been
        passed over very briefly, and entire ascents or descents have been
        disposed of in a single line. Generally speaking, the salient points
        alone have been dwelt upon, and the rest has been left to the
        imagination. This treatment has spared the reader from much useless
        repetition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In endeavouring to
        make the book of some use to those who may wish to go
        mountain-scrambling, whether in the Alps or elsewhere, prominence has
        been given to our mistakes and failures; and to some it may seem that
        our practice must have been bad if the principles which are laid down
        are sound, or that the principles must be unsound if the practice was
        good. The principles which are brought under the notice of the reader
        are, however, deduced from long experience, which experience had not
        been gained at the time that the blunders were perpetrated; and, if
        it had been acquired at an earlier date, there would have been fewer
        failures to record.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My scrambles
        amongst the Alps were a sort of apprenticeship in the art of
        mountaineering, and they were, for the most part, carried out in the
        company of men who were masters of their craft. In any art the
        learner, who wishes to do good work, does well to associate himself
        with master workmen, and I attribute much of the success which is
        recorded in this volume to my having been frequently under the
        guidance of the best mountaineers of the time. The hints and
        observations which are dispersed throughout the volume are not the
        result of personal experience only, they have been frequently derived
        from professional mountaineers, who have studied the art from their
        youth upwards.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevii">[pg
        vii]</span><a name="Pgvii" id="Pgvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without being
        unduly discursive in the narrative, it has not been possible to
        include in the text all the observations which are desirable for the
        general reader, and a certain amount of elementary knowledge has been
        pre-supposed, which perhaps some do not possess; and the opportunity
        is now taken of making a few remarks which may serve to elucidate
        those which follow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a man who is
        not a born mountaineer gets upon the side of a mountain, he speedily
        finds out that walking is an art; and very soon wishes that he could
        be a quadruped or a centipede, or anything except a biped; but, as
        there is a difficulty in satisfying these very natural desires, he
        ultimately procures an alpenstock and turns himself into a tripod.
        This simple implement is invaluable to the mountaineer, and when he
        is parted from it involuntarily (and who has not been?) he is
        inclined to say, just as one may remark of other friends,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“You were only a stick—a poor stick—but you
        were a true friend, and I should like to be in your company
        again.”</span></p><a name="fig01" id="fig01" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=

        "Illustration: Point of Alpenstock" /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Respecting the
        size of the alpenstock, let it be remarked that it may be nearly
        useless if it be too long or too short. It should always be shorter
        than the person who carries it, but it may be any length you like
        between three-fifths of your height and your extreme altitude. It
        should be made of ash, of the very best quality; and should support
        your weight upon its centre when it is suspended at its two ends.
        Unless shod with an iron point it can scarcely be termed an
        alpenstock, and the nature of the point is of some importance. The
        kind I prefer is shown in the <a href="#fig01" class=
        "tei tei-ref">annexed illustration</a>. It has a long tang running
        into the wood, is supported by a rivetted collar, and its termination
        is extremely sharp. With a point of this description steps can be
        made in ice almost as readily as with an axe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A volume might be
        written upon the use of the alpenstock. Its principal use is as a
        third leg, to extend one’s base line; and when the beginner gets this
        well into his head he finds the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>implement of extraordinary value. In these
        latter times the pure and simple alpenstock has gone out of fashion,
        and mountaineers now almost universally carry a stick with a point at
        one end and an axe-head at the other. A moveable axe-head is still a
        desideratum. There is a pick-axe made at Birmingham with a moveable
        head which is better than any other kind that I have seen, but the
        head is too clumsy to be held in the hand, and various improvements
        will have to be effected in it before it will be fit for use in
        mountaineering. Still, its principle appears to me to be capable of
        adaptation, and on that account I have introduced it
        here.</p><a name="fig02" id="fig02" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the
        alpenstock, or axe-alpenstock, it is of most importance for the
        mountaineer to supply himself with plenty of good rope. Enough has
        been said on this subject in different parts of the narrative, as
        well as in regard to tents. Few other articles are <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">necessary</span></span>, though many others are
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">desirable</span></span>, to carry about, and
        amongst the most important may be reckoned some simple means of
        boiling water and cooking. At considerable altitudes above the
        tree-line, it is frequently impossible to carry up wood enough for a
        camp-fire, and nothing but spirits of wine can be employed. The
        well-known and convenient so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“Russian
        furnace”</span> is the most compact form of spirit lamp that I know,
        and wonders can be effected with one that is only <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id="Pgix"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>three inches in diameter. In conjunction
        with a set of tins like those <a href="#fig04" class=
        "tei tei-ref">figured here</a> (which are constructed to be used
        either with a wood fire or over a spirit lamp), all the cooking can
        be done that the Alpine tourist requires. For prolonged expeditions
        of a serious nature a more elaborate equipage is necessary; but upon
        such small ones as are made in the Alps it would be unnecessarily
        encumbering yourself to take a whole <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before passing on
        to speak of clothing, a word upon snow-blindness will not be out of
        place. Very fine language is sometimes used to express the fact that
        persons suffer from their eyes becoming inflamed; and there is one
        well-known traveller, at least, who, when referring to
        snow-blindness, speaks habitually of the distressing effects which
        are produced by <span class="tei tei-q">“the reverberation of the
        snow.”</span> Snow-blindness is a malady which touches all
        mountain-travellers sooner or later, for it is found impossible in
        practice always to protect the eyes with the goggles which are
        <a href="#fig05" class="tei tei-ref">shown overleaf</a>. In critical
        situations almost every one removes them. The beginner should,
        however, note that at great altitudes it is not safe to leave the
        eyes unprotected even on rocks, when the sun is shining brightly; and
        upon snow or ice it is indispensable to shade them in some manner,
        unless you wish to be placed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hors de combat</span></span> on the next day.
        Should you unfortunately find yourself in this predicament through
        the intensity of the light, there is no help but in sulphate of zinc
        and patience. Of the former material a half-ounce will be sufficient
        for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx"
        id="Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a prolonged campaign, as a lotion
        compounded with two or three grains to an ounce of water will give
        relief; but of patience you can hardly lay in too large a stock, as a
        single bad day sometimes throws a man on his back for weeks.<a id=
        "noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whole face
        suffers under the alternation of heat, cold, and glare, and few
        mountain-travellers remain long without having their visages
        blistered and cracked in all directions. Now, in respect to this
        matter, prevention is better than cure; and, though these
        inconveniences cannot be entirely escaped, they may, by taking
        trouble, be deferred for a long time. As a travelling cap for
        mountain expeditions, there is scarcely anything better than the kind
        of helmet used by Arctic travellers, and with the eyes well shaded by
        its projecting peak and covered with the ordinary goggles one ought
        not, and will not, suffer much from snow-blindness. I have found,
        however, that it does not sufficiently shade the face, and that it
        shuts out sound too much when the side-flaps are down; and I
        consequently adopt a woollen headpiece, which almost entirely covers
        or shades the face and extends well downwards on to the shoulders.
        One hears sufficiently <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg
        xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id="Pgxi" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>distinctly through the interstices of the
        knitted wool, and they also permit some ventilation—which the Arctic
        cap does not. It is a useful rather than an ornamental article of
        attire, and strangely affects one’s appearance.</p><a name="fig06"
        id="fig06" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the most
        severe weather even this is not sufficient, and a mask must be added
        to protect the remainder of the face. You then present the appearance
        of the <a href="#fig07" class="tei tei-ref">lower woodcut</a>, and
        are completely disguised. Your most intimate friends—even your own
        mother—will disown you, and you are a fit subject for endless
        ridicule.</p><a name="fig07" id="fig07" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=

        "Illustration: The complete disguise" /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The alternations
        of heat and cold are rapid and severe in all high mountain ranges,
        and it is folly to go about too lightly clad. Woollen gloves ought
        always to be in the mountaineer’s pocket, for in a single hour, or
        less, he may experience a fall in temperature of sixty to eighty
        degrees. But in respect to the nature of the clothing there is little
        to be said beyond that it should be composed of flannels and
        woollens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon the important
        subject of boots much might be written. My friends are generally
        surprised to find that I use elastic-side boots whilst
        mountaineering, and condemn them under the false impression that they
        will not give support to the ankles, and will be pulled off when one
        is traversing deep snow. I have invariably used elastic-side boots on
        my mountain expeditions in the Alps and elsewhere, and have found
        that they give sufficient support to the ankles and never draw off.
        My Alpine boots have always been made by Norman—a maker who knows
        what the requirements are, and one who will give a good boot if
        allowed good time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is fully as
        important to have proper nails in the boots as it <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg xii]</span><a name="Pgxii" id="Pgxii"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is to have good boots. The quantity is
        frequently overdone, and when there are too many they are absolutely
        dangerous. Ice-nails, which may be considered a variety of crampon,
        are an abomination. The nails should be neither too large nor too
        numerous, and they should be disposed everywhere irregularly—not
        symmetrically. They disappear one by one, from time to time; and the
        prudent mountaineer continually examines his boots to see that
        sufficient numbers are left.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=
        "#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> A
        handkerchief tied round the foot, or even a few turns of cord, will
        afford a tolerable substitute when nails cannot be procured.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the beginner
        supplies himself with the articles which have been named, he will be
        in possession of all the gear which is <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></span>
        for ordinary mountain excursions, and if he uses his plant properly
        he will avoid many of the disagreeables which are looked upon by some
        as almost unavoidable accompaniments of the sport of mountaineering.
        I have not throughout the volume ignored the dangers which are real
        and unavoidable, and say distinctly that too great watchfulness
        cannot be exercised at great altitudes. But I say now, as I have
        frequently said before, that the great majority of accidents which
        occur to mountaineers, especially to mountaineering amateurs in the
        Alps, are not the result of unavoidable dangers; and that they are
        for the most part the product of ignorance and neglect. I consider
        that falling rocks are the greatest danger which a mountaineer is
        likely to encounter, and in concluding these prefatory remarks I
        especially warn the novice against the things which tumble about the
        ears of unwary travellers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 23d of July
        1860, I started for my first tour in the Alps. As we steamed out into
        the Channel, Beachy Head came into view, and recalled a scramble of
        many years ago. With the impudence of ignorance, my brother<a id=
        "noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> and I,
        schoolboys both, had tried to scale that great chalk cliff. Not the
        head itself—where sea-birds circle, and where the flints are ranged
        so orderly in parallel lines—but at a place more to the east, where
        the pinnacle called the Devil’s Chimney had fallen down. Since that
        time we have been often in dangers of different kinds, but never have
        we more nearly broken our necks than upon that occasion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Paris I made
        two ascents. The first to the seventh floor of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page2">[pg 2]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a house in the Quartier Latin—to an artist
        friend, who was engaged, at the moment of my entry, in combat with a
        little Jew. He hurled him with great good-will, and with considerable
        force, into some of his crockery, and then recommended me to go up
        the towers of Notre Dame. Half-an-hour later I stood on the parapet
        of the great west front, by the side of the leering fiend which for
        centuries has looked down upon the great city, and then took rail to
        Switzerland; saw the sunlight lingering on the giants of the
        Oberland; heard the echoes from the cow-horns in the Lauterbrunnen
        valley and the avalanches rattling off the Jungfrau; and crossed the
        Gemmi into the Valais.</p><a name="fig09" id="fig09" class=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was bound for
        the valley of Saas, and my work took me high up the Alps on either
        side; far beyond the limit of trees and the tracks of tourists. The
        view from the slopes of the Weissmies, on the eastern side of the
        valley, 5000 or 6000 feet above the village of Saas, is perhaps the
        finest of its kind in the Alps. The full height of the three-peaked
        Mischabel (the highest mountain in Switzerland) is seen at one
        glance; 11,000 feet of dense forests, green alps, rocky pinnacles,
        and glittering glaciers. The peaks seemed to me then to be hopelessly
        inaccessible from this direction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I next descended
        the valley to the village of Stalden, and went up the Visp Thal to
        Zermatt, and stopped there several days. Numerous traces of the
        formidable earthquake-shocks of five years before still remained;
        particularly at St. Nicholas, where the inhabitants had been
        terrified beyond measure at the destruction of their churches and
        houses. At this place, as well as at Visp, a large part of the
        population was obliged to live under canvas for several months. It is
        remarkable that there was hardly a life lost <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page3">[pg 3]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>on this occasion, although there were about
        fifty shocks, some of which were very severe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Zermatt I
        wandered in many directions, but the weather was bad, and my work was
        much retarded. One day, after spending a long time in attempts to
        sketch near the Hörnli, and in futile endeavours to seize the forms
        of the peaks as they for a few seconds peered out from above the
        dense banks of woolly clouds, I determined not to return to Zermatt
        by the usual path, and to cross the Gorner glacier to the Riffel
        hotel. After a rapid scramble over the polished rocks and snowbeds
        which skirt the base of the Théodule glacier, and wading through some
        of the streams which flow from it, at that time much swollen by the
        late rains, the first difficulty was arrived at, in the shape of a
        precipice about three hundred feet high. It seemed that it would be
        easy enough to cross the glacier if the cliff could be descended; but
        higher up, and lower down, the ice appeared, to my inexperienced
        eyes, to be impassable for a single person. The general contour of
        the cliff was nearly perpendicular, but it was a good deal broken up,
        and there was little difficulty in descending by zigzagging from one
        mass to another. At length there was a long slab, nearly smooth,
        fixed at an angle of about forty degrees between two wall-sided
        pieces of rock. Nothing, except the glacier, could be seen below. It
        was an awkward place, but I passed it at length by lying across the
        slab, putting the shoulders stiffly against one side, and the feet
        against the other, and gradually wriggling down, by first moving the
        legs and then the back. When the bottom of the slab was gained a
        friendly crack was seen, into which the point of the baton could be
        stuck, and I dropped down to the next piece. It took a long time
        coming down that little bit of cliff, and for a few seconds it was
        satisfactory to see the ice close at hand. In another moment a second
        difficulty presented itself. The glacier swept round an angle of the
        cliff, and as the ice was not of the nature of treacle or thin putty,
        it kept away from the little bay, on the edge of which I stood. We
        were not widely separated, but the edge of the ice was higher
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg 4]</span><a name="Pg004" id=
        "Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>than the opposite edge of rock;
        and worse, the rock was covered with loose earth and stones which had
        fallen from above. All along the side of the cliff, as far as could
        be seen in both directions, the ice did not touch it, but there was
        this marginal crevasse, seven feet wide, and of unknown depth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this was seen
        at a glance, and almost at once I concluded that I could not jump the
        crevasse, and began to try along the cliff lower down; but without
        success, for the ice rose higher and higher, until at last further
        progress was stopped by the cliffs becoming perfectly smooth. With an
        axe it would have been possible to cut up the side of the ice;
        without one I saw there was no alternative but to return and face the
        jump.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Night was
        approaching, and the solemn stillness of the High Alps was broken
        only by the sound of rushing water or of falling rocks. If the jump
        should be successful,—well; if not, I fell into that horrible chasm,
        to be frozen in, or drowned in that gurgling, rushing water.
        Everything depended on that jump. Again I asked myself, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Can it be done?”</span> It <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></span> be.
        So, finding my stick was useless, I threw it and the sketch-book to
        the ice, and first retreating as far as possible, ran forward with
        all my might, took the leap, barely reached the other side, and fell
        awkwardly on my knees.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The glacier was
        crossed without further trouble, but the Riffel,<a id="noteref_5"
        name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> which was
        then a very small building, was crammed with tourists, and could not
        take me in. As the way down was unknown to me, some of the people
        obligingly suggested getting a man at the chalets, otherwise the path
        would be certainly lost in the forest. On arriving at the chalets no
        man could be found, and the lights <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page5">[pg 5]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>of Zermatt, shining through the trees, seemed to
        say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Never mind a guide, but come along
        down, I’ll show you the way;”</span> so off I went through the
        forest, going straight towards them. The path was lost in a moment,
        and was never recovered. I was tripped up by pine-roots, tumbled over
        rhododendron bushes, fell over rocks. The night was pitch dark, and
        after a time the lights of Zermatt became obscure, or went out
        altogether. By a series of slides, or falls, or evolutions more or
        less disagreeable, the descent through the forest was at length
        accomplished; but torrents of formidable character had still to be
        passed before one could arrive at Zermatt. I felt my way about for
        hours, almost hopelessly; by an exhaustive process at last
        discovering a bridge, and about midnight, covered with dirt and
        scratches, re-entered the inn which I had quitted in the
        morning.</p><a name="fig10" id="fig10" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others besides
        tourists get into difficulties. A day or two afterwards, when on the
        way to my old station, near the Hörnli, I met a stout curé who had
        essayed to cross the Théodule pass. His strength or his wind had
        failed, and he was being carried down, a helpless bundle and a
        ridiculous spectacle, on the back of a lanky guide; while the
        peasants stood by, with folded hands, their reverence for the church
        almost overcome by their sense of the ludicrous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I descended the
        valley, diverging from the path at Randa to mount the slopes of the
        Dom,<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> in order
        to see the Weisshorn face to face. The latter mountain is the noblest
        in Switzerland, and from this direction it looks especially
        magnificent. On its north there is a large snowy plateau that feeds
        the glacier of which a portion is seen from Randa, and which on more
        than one occasion has destroyed that village. From the direction of
        the Dom (that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg
        6]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is,
        immediately opposite) this Bies glacier seems to descend nearly
        vertically. It does not do so, although it is very steep. Its size is
        much less than formerly, and the lower portion, now divided into
        three tails, clings in a strange, weird-like manner to the cliffs, to
        which it seems scarcely possible that it can remain
        attached.</p><a name="fig11" id="fig11" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/illus029.png" alt="Illustration: At the St. Bernard" /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Arriving once more
        in the <span class="tei tei-sic">Rhone</span> valley, I proceeded to
        Viesch, and from thence ascended the Eggischorn; on which unpleasant
        eminence I lost my way in a fog, and my temper shortly afterwards.
        Then, after crossing the Grimsel in a severe thunderstorm, passed on
        to Brienz, Interlachen, and Bern; and thence to Fribourg and Morat,
        Neuchâtel, Martigny, and the St. Bernard. The massive walls of the
        convent were a welcome sight as I waded through the snow-beds near
        the summit of the pass, and pleasant also was the courteous
        salutation of the brother who bade me enter. He wondered at the
        weight of my knapsack, and I at the hardness of his bread. The saying
        that the monks make the toast in the winter that they give to
        tourists in the following season is not founded on truth; the winter
        is their most busy time of the year. But it <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span> true
        they have exercised so much hospitality, that at times they have not
        possessed the means to furnish the fuel for heating their chapel in
        the winter.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instead of
        descending to Aosta, I turned aside into the Val Pelline, in order to
        obtain views of the Dent d’Erin. The night had come on before Biona
        was gained, and I had to knock long and loud upon the door of the
        curé’s house before it was opened. An old woman, with querulous
        voice, and with a large goître, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a>answered the summons, and demanded rather
        sharply what was wanted; but became pacific—almost good-natured—when
        a five-franc piece was held in her face, and she heard that lodging
        and supper were requested in exchange.</p><a name="fig12" id="fig12"

        asserted that a passage existed from Prerayen, at the head of this
        valley, to Breil,<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href=
        "#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> in the
        Val Tournanche, and the old woman, now convinced of my
        respectability, busied herself to find a guide. Presently she
        introduced a native, picturesquely attired in high-peaked hat,
        braided jacket, scarlet waistcoat, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page8">[pg 8]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>indigo pantaloons, who agreed to take me to the
        village of Val Tournanche. We set off early on the next morning, and
        got to the summit of the pass without difficulty. It gave me my first
        experience of considerable slopes of hard steep snow, and, like all
        beginners, I endeavoured to prop myself up with my stick, and kept it
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">outside</span></span>, instead of holding it
        between myself and the slope, and leaning upon it, as should have
        been done. The man enlightened me; but he had, properly, a very small
        opinion of his employer, and it is probably on that account that, a
        few minutes after we had passed the summit, he said he would not go
        any further and would return to Biona. All argument was useless; he
        stood still, and to everything that was said answered nothing but
        that he would go back. Being rather nervous about descending some
        long snow-slopes, which still intervened between us and the head of
        the valley, I offered more pay, and he went on a little way.
        Presently there were some cliffs down which we had to scramble. He
        called to me to stop, then shouted that he would go back, and
        beckoned to me to come up. On the contrary, I waited for him to come
        down; but instead of doing so, in a second or two he turned round,
        clambered deliberately up the cliff, and vanished. I supposed it was
        only a ruse to extort offers of more money, and waited for
        half-an-hour, but he did not appear again. This was rather
        embarrassing, for he carried off my knapsack. The choice of action
        lay between chasing him and going on to Breil, risking the loss of my
        knapsack. I chose the latter course, and got to Breil the same
        evening. The landlord of the inn, suspicious of a person entirely
        innocent of luggage, was doubtful if he could admit me, and
        eventually thrust me into a kind of loft, which was already occupied
        by guides and by hay. In later years we became good friends, and he
        did not hesitate to give credit and even to advance considerable
        sums.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My sketches from
        Breil were made under difficulties, for my materials had been carried
        off. Nothing better than fine sugar-paper could be obtained, and the
        pencils seemed to contain more <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page9">[pg 9]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class=

        crossed, this time alone. By the following evening the old woman of
        Biona again produced the faithless guide. The knapsack was recovered
        after the lapse of several hours, and then I poured forth all the
        terms of abuse and reproach of which I was master. The man smiled
        when called a liar, and shrugged his shoulders when referred to as a
        thief, but drew his knife when spoken of as a pig.</p><a name="fig13"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
        night was spent at Courmayeur, and the day after I crossed the Col
        Ferret to Orsières, and on the next the Tête Noire to Chamounix. The
        Emperor Napoleon arrived on the same day, and access to the Mer de
        Glace was refused to tourists; but, by scrambling along the Plan des
        Aiguilles, I managed to outwit the guards, and to arrive at the
        Montanvert as the Imperial party <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        to the Jardin, but very nearly succeeding in breaking a leg by
        dislodging great rocks on the moraine of the glacier.</p><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From Chamounix I
        went to Geneva, and thence by the Mont Cenis to Turin and to the
        Vaudois valleys. A long and weary day had ended when Paesana was
        reached. The inn was full, and I was tired, and about to go to bed,
        when some village stragglers entered and began to sing. They sang to
        Garibaldi! The tenor, a ragged fellow, whose clothes were not worth a
        shilling, took the lead with wonderful expression and feeling. The
        others kept their places, and sang in admirable time. For hours I sat
        enchanted; and, long after I retired, the sound of their melody could
        be heard, relieved at times by the treble of the girl who belonged to
        the inn.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next morning I
        passed the little lakes, which are the sources of the Po, on my way
        into France. The weather was stormy, and misinterpreting the patois
        of some natives—who in reality pointed out the right way—I missed the
        track, and found myself under the cliffs of Monte Viso. A gap that
        was occasionally seen, in the ridge connecting it with the mountains
        to the east, tempted me up; and, after a battle with a snow-slope of
        excessive steepness, I reached the summit. The scene was
        extraordinary, and, in my experience, unique. To the north there was
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span><a name="Pg011"
        id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not a particle of mist, and the
        violent wind coming from that direction blew one back staggering. But
        on the side of Italy, the valleys were completely filled with dense
        masses of cloud to a certain level; and there—where they felt the
        influence of the wind—they were cut off as level as the top of a
        table, the ridges appearing above them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I raced down to
        Abries, and went on through the gorge of the Guil to Mont Dauphin.
        The next day found me at La Bessée, at the junction of the Val Louise
        with the valley of the Durance, in full view of Mont Pelvoux; and by
        chance I walked into a cabaret where a Frenchman was breakfasting,
        who, a few days before, had made an unsuccessful attempt to ascend
        that mountain with three Englishmen and the guide Michel Croz of
        Chamounix;<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href=
        "#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        good fellow, by name Jean Reynaud.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same night I
        slept at Briançon, intending to take the courier on the following day
        to Grenoble; but all places had been secured several days beforehand,
        so I set out at two <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> on the next day for a
        seventy-mile walk. The weather was again bad; and on the summit of
        the Col de Lautaret I was forced to seek shelter in the wretched
        little hospice. It was filled with workmen who were employed on the
        road, and with noxious vapours which proceeded from them. The
        inclemency of the weather was preferable to the inhospitality of the
        interior. Outside, it was disagreeable, but grand; inside, it was
        disagreeable and mean.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=
        "#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> The walk
        was continued under a deluge of rain, and I felt the way down—so
        intense was the darkness—to the village of La Grave, where the people
        of the inn detained me forcibly. It was perhaps fortunate that they
        did so; for, during that night, blocks of rock fell at several places
        from the cliffs on to the road with such force that they made large
        pits in the macadam. I resumed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page12">[pg 12]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the walk at half-past five the next morning, and
        proceeded, under steady rain, through Bourg d’Oysans to Grenoble,
        arriving at the latter place soon after seven <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span>, having
        accomplished the entire distance from Briançon in about eighteen
        hours of actual walking.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The district of
        which Mont Pelvoux and the neighbouring summits are the culminating
        points,<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href=
        "#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> is, both
        historically and topographically, one of the most interesting in the
        Alps. As the nursery and the home of the Vaudois, it has claims to
        permanent attention. The names of Waldo and of Neff will be
        remembered when men <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg
        14]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more
        famous in their time will be forgotten; and the memory of the heroic
        courage and the simple piety of their disciples will endure as long
        as history lasts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This district
        contains the highest summits in France, and some of its finest
        scenery. It has not perhaps the beauties of Switzerland, but has
        charms of its own; its cliffs, its torrents, and its gorges are
        unsurpassed; its deep and savage valleys present pictures of
        grandeur, and even sublimity, and it is second to none in the
        boldness of its mountain forms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The district
        includes a mass of valleys which vie with each other in singularity
        of character and dissimilarity of climate. Some the rays of the sun
        can never reach, they are so deep and narrow.<a id="noteref_13" name=
        "noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> In
        others the very antipodes may be found; the temperature more like
        that of the plains of Italy than of Alpine France. This great range
        of climate has a marked effect on the flora of these valleys.
        Sterility reigns in some; stones take the place of trees; débris and
        mud replace plants and flowers: in others, in the space of a few
        miles, one passes vines, apple, pear, and cherry trees, the birch,
        alder, walnut, ash, larch, and pine, alternating with fields of rye,
        barley, oats, beans, and potatoes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The valleys are
        for the most part short and erratic. They are not, apparently,
        arranged on any definite plan. They are not disposed, as is
        frequently the case elsewhere, either at right angles to, or parallel
        with, the highest summits; but they wander hither and thither, take
        one direction for a few miles, then double back, and then perhaps
        resume their original course. Thus, long perspectives are rarely to
        be seen, and it is difficult to form a general idea of the
        disposition of the peaks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The highest
        summits are arranged almost in a horse-shoe form. The highest of all,
        which occupies a central position, is the Pointe <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>des Ecrins; the second in height, the
        Meije,<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href=
        "#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> is on
        the north; and the Mont Pelvoux, which gives its name to the entire
        block, stands almost detached by itself on the outside.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The district is
        still very imperfectly known; there are probably many valleys, and
        there are certainly many summits which have never been trodden by the
        feet of tourists or travellers; but in 1861 it was even less known.
        Until quite recently there was, practically, no map of it;<a id=
        "noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> General
        Bourcet’s, which was the best that was published, was completely
        wrong in its delineation of the mountains, and was frequently
        incorrect in regard to paths or roads.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mountainous
        regions of Dauphiné, moreover, are not supplied, like Switzerland,
        Tyrol, or even the Italian valleys, with accommodation for
        travellers. The inns, when they exist, are often filthy beyond
        description; rest is seldom obtained in their beds, or decent food
        found in their kitchens, and there are no local guides worth having.
        The tourist is thrown very much on his own resources, and it is not
        therefore surprising that these districts are less visited and less
        known than the rest of the Alps.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most of the
        statements current in 1861 respecting these mountains had been
        derived from two authors<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href=
        "#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>—M. Elie
        de Beaumont <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg
        16]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        the late Principal J. D. Forbes. Their works, however, contained
        numerous errors in regard to the identification of the peaks, and,
        amongst others, they referred the supremacy to the Mont Pelvoux, the
        highest point of which they termed the Pointe des Arcines, or des
        Ecrins. Principal Forbes erroneously identified the high peak seen
        from the valley of St. Christophe, with that seen from the valley of
        the Durance, and spoke of both as the Mont Pelvoux, and M. de
        Beaumont committed similar mistakes. In point of fact, at the time
        when M. de Beaumont and Forbes wrote their respective memoirs, the
        proper relation of the Mont Pelvoux to the neighbouring summits had
        been determined by the engineers employed on the survey for the map
        of France, but their observations were not then accessible to the
        public, although they had evidently been seen by M. de Beaumont. This
        party of surveyors, led by Captain Durand, made the ascent of Mont
        Pelvoux from the side of the Val d’Ailefroide—that is, from the
        direction of Val Louise—in 1828. According to the natives of the Val
        Louise, they got to the top of the second peak in height, and
        remained upon it, lodged in a tent for several days, at a height of
        12,904 feet. They took numerous porters to carry wood for fires, and
        erected a large cairn on the summit, which has caused the name of Pic
        de la Pyramide to be given to their summit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1848, M.
        Puiseux made the ascent from the same direction, but his Val Louisan
        guide stopped short of the summit, and allowed this courageous
        astronomer to proceed by himself.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17"
        href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the middle of
        August 1860, Messrs. Bonney, Hawkshaw, and Mathews, with Michel Croz
        of Chamounix, tried to ascend the Pelvoux, likewise from the same
        direction. These gentlemen spent <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page17">[pg 17]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>several days and nights upon the mountain; and,
        encountering bad weather, only attained a height of 10,430 feet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">M. Jean Reynaud,
        of whom mention has been made in the preceding chapter, accompanied
        the party of Mr. Mathews, and he was of opinion that the attempt had
        been made too late in the season. He said that the weather was
        usually good enough for high mountain ascents <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></span>
        during the last few days of July, and the first ones of August,<a id=
        "noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> and
        suggested that we should attempt to ascend the mountain in the
        following year at that time. The proposition was a tempting one, and
        Reynaud’s cordial and modest manner made it irresistible, although
        there seemed small chance that we should succeed where a party such
        as that of Mr. Mathews had been beaten.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the beginning
        of July 1861, I despatched to Reynaud from Havre, blankets (which
        were taxed as <span class="tei tei-q">“prohibited fabrics”</span>),
        rope, and other things desirable for the excursion, and set out on
        the tour of France; but, four weeks later, at Nîmes, found myself
        completely collapsed by the heat, then 94° Faht. in the shade, and
        took a night train at once to Grenoble.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Grenoble is a town
        upon which a volume might be written. Its situation is probably the
        finest of any in France, and the views from its high forts are
        superb. I lost my way in the streets of this picturesque and noisome
        town, and having but a half-hour left in which to get a dinner and
        take a place in the diligence, was not well pleased to hear that an
        Englishman wished to see me. It turned out to be my friend Macdonald,
        who confided to me that he was going to try to ascend a mountain
        called Pelvoux in the course of ten days. On hearing of my
        intentions, he agreed to join us at La Bessée on the 3rd of August.
        In a few moments <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg
        18]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more
        I was perched in the banquette <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">en route</span></span> for Bourg d’Oysans, in a
        miserable vehicle which took nearly eight hours to accomplish less
        than 30 miles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At five on a
        lovely morning I shouldered my knapsack and started for Briançon.
        Gauzy mists clung to the mountains, but melted away when touched by
        the sun, and disappeared by jerks (in the manner of views when
        focussed in a magic lantern), revealing the wonderfully bent and
        folded strata in the limestone cliffs behind the town. Then I entered
        the Combe de Malval, and heard the Romanche eating its way through
        that wonderful gorge, and passed on to Le Dauphin, where the first
        glacier came into view, tailing over the mountain-side on the right.
        From this place until the summit of the Col de Lautaret was passed,
        every gap in the mountains showed a glittering glacier or a soaring

        middle distance, but still ten miles off, is Briançon with its
        interminable forts, and in the foreground, leading down to the
        Guisane, and rising high up the neighbouring slopes, are fertile
        fields, studded with villages and church spires. The next day I
        walked over from Briançon to La Bessée, to my worthy friend Jean
        Reynaud, the surveyor of roads of his district.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the peaks of
        Mont Pelvoux are well seen from La Bessée—the highest point, as well
        as that upon which the engineers erected their cairn. Neither Reynaud
        nor any one else knew this. The natives knew only that the engineers
        had ascended one peak, and had seen from that one a still higher
        point, which they called the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg
        19]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Pointe des Arcines or des Ecrins. They could not
        say whether this latter could be seen from La Bessée, nor could they
        tell the peak upon which the cairn had been erected. We were under
        the impression that the highest point was concealed by the peaks
        which we saw, and would be gained by passing over them. They knew
        nothing of the ascent of Monsieur Puiseux, and they confidently
        asserted that the highest point of Mont Pelvoux had not been attained
        by any one. It was this point we wished to reach.</p><a name="fig17"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing prevented
        our starting at once but the absence of Macdonald and the want of a
        bâton. Reynaud suggested a visit to the postmaster, who possessed a
        bâton of local celebrity. Down we went to the bureau; but it was
        closed: we halloed through the slits, but no answer. At last the
        postmaster was discovered endeavouring (with very fair success) to
        make himself intoxicated. He was just able to ejaculate, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“France! ’tis the first nation in the world!”</span>
        which is a phrase used by a Frenchman at times when <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a Briton would begin to shout,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We won’t go home till
        morning”</span>—national glory being uppermost in the thoughts of
        one, and home in those of the other. The bâton was produced; it was a
        branch of a young oak, about five feet long, gnarled and twisted in
        several directions. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said the
        postmaster, as he presented it, <span class="tei tei-q">“France! ’tis
        the first—the first nation in the world, by its”</span>—he stuck.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Bâtons?”</span> I suggested. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, yes, sir; by its bâtons, by its—its,”</span> and
        here he could not get on at all. As I looked at this young limb, I
        thought of my own; but Reynaud, who knew everything about everybody
        in the village, said there was not a better one, so off we went with
        it, leaving the official staggering in the road and muttering,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“France! ’tis the first nation in the
        world!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The 3rd of August
        came, and Macdonald did not appear, so we started for the Val Louise;
        our party consisting of Reynaud, myself, and a porter, Jean Casimir
        Giraud, nicknamed <span class="tei tei-q">“little nails,”</span> the
        shoemaker of the place. An hour and a half’s smart walking took us to
        La Ville de Val Louise, our hearts gladdened by the glorious peaks of
        Pelvoux shining out without a cloud around them. I renewed
        acquaintance with the mayor of <span class="tei tei-q">“La
        Ville.”</span> His aspect was original, and his manners were
        gracious, but the odour which proceeded from him was dreadful.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reynaud kindly
        undertook to look after the commissariat, and I found to my
        annoyance, when we were about to leave, that I had given tacit
        consent to a small wine-cask being carried with us, which was a great
        nuisance from the commencement. It was excessively awkward to handle;
        one man tried to carry it, and then another, and at last it was slung
        from one of our bâtons, and was carried by two of us, which gave our
        party the appearance of a mechanical diagram to illustrate the uses
        of levers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“La Ville”</span> the Val Louise splits into two
        branches—the Val d’Entraigues on the left and the Vallon d’Alefred
        (or Ailefroide) on the right; our route was up the latter, and we
        moved steadily forwards to the village of La Pisse, where Pierre
        Sémiond lived, who <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg
        21]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was
        reputed to know more about the Pelvoux than any other man. He looked
        an honest fellow, but unfortunately he was ill and could not come. He
        recommended his brother, an aged creature, whose furrowed and
        wrinkled face hardly seemed to announce the man we wanted; but having
        no choice, we engaged him and again set forth. Walnut and a great
        variety of other trees gave shadow to our path and fresh vigour to
        our limbs; while below, in a sublime gorge, thundered the torrent,
        whose waters took their rise from the snows we hoped to tread on the
        morrow.</p><a name="fig18" id="fig18" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Pelvoux could
        not be seen at La Ville, owing to a high intervening ridge; we were
        now moving along the foot of this to get to the châlets of Alefred,
        or, as they are sometimes called, Aléfroide, where the mountain
        actually commences. From these châlets the subordinate, but more
        proximate, peaks appear considerably higher than the loftier ones
        behind, and sometimes completely conceal them. But the whole height
        of the peak, which in these valleys goes under the name of the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Grand Pelvoux,”</span> is seen at one glance
        from its summit to its base, six or seven thousand feet of nearly
        perpendicular cliffs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The châlets of
        Alefred are a cluster of miserable wooden huts <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at the foot of the Grand Pelvoux, and are
        close to the junction of the streams which descend from the glacier
        de Sapenière (or du Selé) on the left, and the glaciers Blanc and
        Noir on the right. We rested a minute to purchase some butter and
        milk, and Sémiond picked up a disreputable-looking lad to assist in
        carrying, pushing, and otherwise moving the wine-cask.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our route now
        turned sharply to the left, and all were glad that the day was
        drawing to a close, so that we had the shadows from the mountains. A
        more frightful and desolate valley it is scarcely possible to
        imagine; it contains miles of boulders, débris, stones, sand, and
        mud; few trees, and they placed so high as to be almost out of sight;
        not a soul inhabits it; no birds are in the air, no fish in its
        waters; the mountain is too steep for the chamois, its slopes too
        inhospitable for the marmot, the whole too repulsive for the eagle.
        Not a living thing did we see in this sterile and savage valley
        during four days, except some few poor goats which had been driven
        there against their will.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a scene in
        keeping with the diabolical deed perpetrated here about four hundred
        years ago—the murder of the Vaudois of Val Louise, in the cavern
        which was now in sight, though high above us. Their story is very
        sad. Peaceful and industrious, for more than three centuries they had
        inhabited these retired valleys in tranquil obscurity. The
        Archbishops of Embrun endeavoured, though with little success, to get
        them within the pale of their church. Their efforts were aided by
        others, who commenced by imprisonments and torture,<a id="noteref_21"
        name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> and at
        last adopted the method of burning them by hundreds at the
        stake.<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href=
        "#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the year 1488,
        Albert Cattanée, Archdeacon of Cremona and <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page23">[pg 23]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>legate of Pope Innocent VIII., would have
        anticipated the barbarities which at a later date roused the
        indignation of Milton and the fears of Cromwell;<a id="noteref_23"

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> but,
        driven everywhere back by the Waldenses of Piedmont, he left their
        valleys and crossed the Mont Genèvre to attack the weaker and more
        thinly populated valleys of the Vaudois in Dauphiné. At the head of
        an army which is said to have been composed of vagabonds, robbers,
        and assassins (who had been tempted to his banner by promises of
        absolution beforehand, of being set free from the obligation of vows
        which they might have made, and by the confirmation of property to
        them which they might have wrongfully acquired), as well as regular
        troops, Cattanée poured down the valley of the Durance. The
        inhabitants of the Val Louise fled before a host that was ten times
        their number, and took up their abode in this cavern, where they had
        collected provisions sufficient for two years. But intolerance is
        ever painstaking; their retreat was discovered. Cattanée had a
        captain who combined the resources of a Herod to the cruelty of a
        Pelissier, and, lowering his men by ropes, fired piles of brushwood
        at the entrance to the cavern, suffocated the majority, and slew the
        remainder. The Vaudois were relentlessly exterminated, without
        distinction of age or sex. More than three thousand persons, it is
        said, perished in this frightful massacre; the growth of three
        hundred and fifty years was destroyed at one blow, and the valley was
        completely depopulated. Louis XII. caused it to be re-peopled, and,
        after another three centuries and a half, behold the result—a race of
        monkeys.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href=
        "#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We rested a little
        at a small spring, and then hastened onwards till we nearly arrived
        at the foot of the Sapenière glacier, when Sémiond said we must turn
        to the right, up the slopes. This we did, and clambered for
        half-an-hour through scattered firs and fallen boulders. Then evening
        began to close in rapidly, and it was time to look for a
        resting-place. There was no difficulty in getting one, for all around
        there was a chaotic assemblage of rocks. We selected the under side
        of a boulder which was more than fifty feet long by twenty high,
        cleared out the rubbish, and then collected wood for a fire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have a pleasant
        recollection of that camp-fire. The wine-cask had got through all its
        troubles; it was tapped, and the Frenchmen seemed to derive some
        consolation from its execrable contents. Reynaud chanted scraps of
        French songs, and each contributed his share of joke, story, or
        verse. The weather was perfect, and our prospects for the morrow were
        good. My companions’ joy culminated when a packet of red <a name=
        "corr024" id="corr024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
        "tei tei-corr">fir</span> was thrown into the flames. It hissed and
        bubbled for a moment or two, and then broke out into a grand flare.
        The effect of the momentary light was magnificent; the mountains all
        around were illuminated for a second, and then relapsed into their
        solemn gloom. One by one our party dropped off to sleep, and at last
        I got into my blanket-bag. It was hardly necessary, for although we
        were at a height of at least 7000 feet, the minimum temperature was
        above 40° Fahrenheit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We roused at
        three, and made a start at half-past four. Giraud had been engaged as
        far as this rock only, but as he wished to go on, we allowed him to
        accompany us. We mounted the slopes and quickly got above the trees,
        then had a couple of hours’ clambering over bits of precipitous rock
        and banks of débris, and, at a quarter to seven, got to a narrow
        glacier—Clos de l’Homme—which streamed out of the plateau on the
        summit, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span><a name=
        "Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and nearly reached the
        glacier de Sapenière. We worked as much as possible to the right, in
        hopes that we should not have to cross it, but were continually
        driven back, and at last we found that over we must go. Old Sémiond
        had a strong objection to the ice, and made explorations on his own
        account to endeavour to avoid it; but Reynaud and I preferred to
        cross it, and Giraud stuck to us. It was narrow—in fact, one could
        throw a stone across—and it was easily mounted on the side; but in
        the centre swelled into a steep dome, up which we were obliged to
        cut. Giraud stepped forward and said he should like to try his hand,
        and having got hold of the axe, would not give it up; and here, as
        well as afterwards when it was necessary to cross the gullies filled
        with hard snow, which abound on the higher part of the mountain, he
        did all the work, and did it admirably.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Old Sémiond of
        course came after us when we got across. We then zigzagged up some
        snow-slopes, and shortly afterwards commenced to ascend the
        interminable array of buttresses which are the great peculiarity of
        the Pelvoux.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href=
        "#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> They
        were very steep in many places, yet on the whole afforded good hold,
        and no climbing should be called difficult which does that. Gullies
        abounded among them, sometimes of great length and depth.
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">They</span></span> were frequently rotten, and
        would have been difficult for a single man to pass. The uppermost men
        were continually abused for dislodging rocks and for harpooning those
        below with their bâtons. However, without these incidents the
        climbing would have been dull—they helped to break the monotony.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We went up
        chimneys and gullies by the hour together, and always seemed to be
        coming to something, although we never got to it. The outline sketch
        will help to explain the situation. We stood at the foot of a great
        buttress—perhaps about 200 feet high—and looked up. It did not go to
        a point as in the diagram, because we could not see the top; although
        we felt convinced <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg
        26]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that
        behind the fringe of pinnacles we did see there was a top, and that
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">it</span></span> was the edge of the plateau we
        so much desired to attain. Up we mounted, and reached the pinnacles;
        but, lo! another set was seen,—and another,—and yet more—till at last
        we reached the top, and found it was only a buttress, and that we
        must descend 40 or 50 feet before we could commence to mount again.
        When this operation had been performed a few dozen times, it began to
        be wearisome, especially as we were in the dark as to our
        whereabouts. Sémiond, however, encouraged us, and said he knew we
        were on the right route,—so away we went once more.</p><a name=

        mid-day, and we seemed no nearer the summit of the Pelvoux than when
        we started. At last we all joined together and held a council.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Sémiond, old friend, do you know where we
        are now?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh yes, perfectly, to a
        yard and a half.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, then, how
        much are we below this plateau?”</span> He affirmed we were not
        half-an-hour from the edge of the snow. <span class="tei tei-q">“Very
        good; let us proceed.”</span> Half-an-hour passed, and then another,
        but we were still in the same state,—pinnacles, buttresses, and
        gullies were in profusion, but the plateau was not in sight. So we
        called him again—for he had been staring about latterly, as if in
        doubt—and repeated the question. <span class="tei tei-q">“How far
        below are we now?”</span> Well, he thought it might be half-an-hour
        more. <span class="tei tei-q">“But you said that just now; are you
        sure we are going right?”</span> Yes, he believed we were. Believed!
        that would not do. <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you sure we are going
        right for the Pic des Arcines?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Pic
        des Arcines!”</span> he ejaculated in astonishment, as if he had
        heard the words for the first time. <span class="tei tei-q">“Pic des
        Arcines; no! but for the pyramid, the celebrated pyramid he had
        helped the great Capitaine Durand,”</span> &amp;c.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here was a fix;—we
        had been talking about it to him for a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>whole day, and now he confessed he knew nothing
        about it. I turned to Reynaud, who seemed thunderstruck. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What did he suggest?”</span> He shrugged his shoulders.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> we said, after explaining our
        minds pretty freely to Sémiond, <span class="tei tei-q">“the sooner
        we turn back the better, for we have no wish to see your
        pyramid.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We halted for an
        hour, and then commenced the descent. It took us nearly seven hours
        to come down to our rock; but I paid no heed to the distance, and do
        not remember anything about it. When we got down we made a discovery
        which affected us as much as the footprint in the sand did Robinson
        Crusoe: a blue silk veil lay by our fireside. There was but one
        explanation,—Macdonald had arrived; but where was he? We soon packed
        our baggage, and tramped in the dusk, through the stony desert, to
        Alefred, where we arrived about half-past nine. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Where is the Englishman?”</span> was the first question.
        He was gone to sleep at La Ville.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We passed that
        night in a hay-loft, and in the morning, after settling with Sémiond,
        posted down to catch Macdonald. We had already determined on the plan
        of operation, which was to get him to join us, return, and be
        independent of all guides, simply taking the best man we could get as
        a porter. I set my heart on Giraud,—a good fellow, with no pretence,
        although in every respect up to the work. We were disappointed; he
        was obliged to go to Briançon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The walk soon
        became exciting. The natives inquired the result of our expedition,
        and common civility obliged us to stop. But I was afraid of losing my
        man, for it was said he would wait only till ten o’clock, and that
        time was near at hand. At last I dashed over the bridge,—time from
        Alefred an hour and a quarter. A cantonnier stopped me, saying that
        the Englishman had just started for La Bessée. I rushed after him,
        turned angle after angle of the road, but could not see him; at last,
        as I came round a corner, he was also just turning another, going
        very fast. I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg
        28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>shouted, and luckily he heard me. We returned,
        reprovisioned ourselves at La Ville, and the same evening saw us
        passing our first rock, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">en route</span></span> for another. I have said
        we determined to take no guide; but, on passing La Pisse, old Sémiond
        turned out and offered his services. He went well, in spite of his
        years and disregard of truth. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why not take
        him?”</span> said my friend. So we offered him a fifth of his
        previous pay, and in a few seconds he closed with the offer. This
        time he came in an inferior position,—we were to lead, he to follow.
        Our second follower was a youth of twenty-seven years, who was not
        all that could be desired. He drank Reynaud’s wine, smoked our
        cigars, and quietly secreted the provisions when we were nearly
        starving. Discovery of his proceedings did not at all disconcert him,
        and he finished up by getting several items added to our bill at La
        Ville, which, not a little to his disgust, we disallowed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This night we
        fixed our camp high above the tree-line, and indulged ourselves in
        the healthy employment of carrying our fuel up to it. The present
        rock was not so comfortable as the first, and, before we could settle
        down, we were obliged to turn out a large mass which was in the way.
        It was very obstinate, but moved at length; slowly and gently at
        first, then faster and faster, at last taking great jumps in the air,
        striking a stream of fire at every touch, which shone out brightly as
        it entered the gloomy valley below, and long after it was out of
        sight, we heard it bounding downwards, and then settle with a subdued
        crash on the glacier beneath. As we turned back from this curious
        sight, Reynaud asked if we had ever seen a torrent on fire, and told
        us that in the spring the Durance, swollen by the melting of the
        snow, sometimes brings down so many rocks that, where it passes
        through a narrow gorge at La Bessée, no water whatever is seen, but
        only boulders rolling over and over, grinding each other into powder,
        and striking so many sparks that the stream looks as if it were on
        fire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We had another
        merry evening with nothing to mar it; the <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>weather was perfect, and we lay backward in
        luxurious repose, looking at the sky spangled with its ten thousand
        brilliant lights.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Macdonald related
        his experiences over the café noir. He had travelled day and night
        for several days in order to join us, but had failed to find our
        first bivouac, and had camped a few hundred yards from us under
        another rock, higher up the mountain. The next morning he discerned
        us going along a ridge at a great height above him, and as it was
        useless to endeavour to overtake us, he lay down and watched with a
        heavy heart until we had turned the corner of a buttress, and
        vanished out of sight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing but the
        heavy breathing of our already sound asleep comrades broke the solemn
        stillness of the night. It was a silence to be felt. Nothing? Hark!
        what is that dull booming sound above us? Is that nothing? There it
        is again, plainer—on it comes, nearer, clearer; ’tis a crag escaped
        from the heights above! What a fearful crash! We jump to our feet.
        Down it comes with awful fury; what power can withstand its violence?
        Dancing, leaping, flying; dashing against others; roaring as it
        descends. Ah, it has passed! No; there it is again, and we hold our
        breath, as, with resistless force and explosions like artillery, it
        darts past, with an avalanche of shattered fragments trailing in its
        rear! ’Tis <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg
        30]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gone,
        and we breathe more freely as we hear the finale on the glacier
        below.<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href=
        "#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We retired at
        last, but I was too excited to sleep. At a quarter-past four every
        man once more shouldered his pack and started. This time we agreed to
        keep more to the right, to see if it were not possible to get to the
        plateau without losing any time by crossing the glacier. To describe
        our route would be to repeat what has been said before. We mounted
        steadily for an hour and a half, sometimes walking, though more
        frequently climbing, and then found, after all, that it was necessary
        to cross the glacier. The part on which we struck came down a very
        steep slope, and was much crevassed. The word crevassed hardly
        expresses its appearance—it was a mass of formidable séracs. We
        found, however, more difficulty in getting on than across it; and,
        thanks to the rope, it was passed in safety. Then the interminable
        buttresses began again. Hour after hour we proceeded upwards,
        frequently at fault, and obliged to descend. The ridge behind us had
        sunk long ago, and we looked over it, and all others, till our eyes
        rested on the majestic Viso. Hour after hour passed, and monotony was
        the order of the day. When twelve o’clock came we lunched, and
        contemplated the scene with satisfaction; all the summits in sight,
        with the single exception of the Viso, had given in, and we looked
        over an immense expanse—a perfect sea of peaks and snow-fields. Still
        the pinnacles rose above us, and opinions were freely uttered that we
        should see no summit of Pelvoux that day. Old Sémiond had become a
        perfect bore to all; whenever one rested for a moment to look about,
        he would say, with a complacent chuckle, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Don’t be afraid, follow me.”</span> We came at last to a
        very bad piece, rotten and steep, and no hold. Here Reynaud and
        Macdonald confessed to being tired, and talked of going to sleep. A
        way was discovered out of the difficulty; then some one called out,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Look at the Viso!”</span> and we saw that we
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span><a name="Pg031"
        id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>almost looked over it. We
        worked away with redoubled energy, and at length caught sight of the
        head of the glacier as it streamed out of the plateau. This gave us
        fresh hopes; we were not deceived; and with a simultaneous shout we
        greeted the appearance of our long-wished-for snows. A large crevasse
        separated us from them; but a bridge was found; we tied ourselves in
        line, and moved safely over it. Directly we got across, there rose
        before us a fine snow-capped peak. Old Sémiond cried, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The pyramid! I see the pyramid!”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Where, Sémiond, where?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There; on the top of that peak.”</span></p><a name=
        "fig21" id="fig21" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/illus054.png" alt=
        "Illustration: Outline to show route up Mont Pelvoux" /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There, sure
        enough, was the cairn he had helped to erect more than thirty years
        before. Where was the Pic des Arcines which we were to see? It was
        nowhere visible—there was only a great expanse of snow, bordered by
        three lower peaks. Somewhat sadly we moved towards the pyramid,
        sighing that there was no other to conquer; but hardly had we gone
        two hundred paces, before there rose a superb white cone on the left,
        which had been hidden before by a slope of snow. We shouted,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Pic des Arcines!”</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span><a name="Pg032"
        id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>inquired of Sémiond if he knew
        whether that peak had been ascended. As for him, he knew nothing,
        except that the peak before us was called the pyramid, from the cairn
        he had, etc. etc., and that it had not been ascended since.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“All right then—face about,”</span> and we
        immediately turned at right angles for the cone, the porter making
        faint struggles for his beloved pyramid. Our progress was stopped, in
        the sixth of a mile, by the edge of the ridge connecting the two
        peaks, and we perceived that it curled over in a lovely volute. We
        involuntarily retreated. Sémiond, who was last in the line, took the
        opportunity to untie himself, and refused to come on; said we were
        running dangerous risks, and talked vaguely of crevasses. We tied him
        up again, and proceeded. The snow was very soft; we were always
        knee-deep, and sometimes floundered in up to the waist; but a
        simultaneous jerk before and behind always released one. By this time
        we had arrived at the foot of the final peak. The left-hand ridge
        seemed easier than that upon which we stood, so we curved round to
        get to it. Some rocks peeped out 150 feet below the summit, and up
        these we crawled, leaving our porter behind, as he said he was
        afraid. I could not resist the temptation, as we went off, to turn
        round and beckon him onwards, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Don’t
        be afraid—follow me,”</span> but he did not answer to the appeal, and
        never went to the top. The rocks led to a short ridge of ice—our
        plateau on one side, and a nearly vertical precipice on the other.
        Macdonald cut up it, and at a quarter to two we stood shaking hands
        on the loftiest summit of the conquered Pelvoux.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day still
        continued everything that could be desired, and, far and near,
        countless peaks burst into sight, without a cloud to hide them. The
        mighty Mont Blanc, full seventy miles away, first caught our eyes,
        and then, still farther off, the Monte Rosa group; while, rolling
        away to the east, one unknown range after another succeeded in
        unveiled splendour; fainter and fainter in tone, but still perfectly
        defined, till at last the eye was unable to distinguish sky from
        mountain, and they died away in the far-off horizon. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Monte Viso rose up grandly, but it was
        less than forty miles away, and we looked over it to a hazy mass we
        knew must be the plains of Piedmont. Southwards a blue mist seemed to
        indicate the existence of the distant Mediterranean; to the west we
        looked over to the mountains of Auvergne. Such was the panorama; a
        view extending in nearly every direction for more than one hundred
        miles. It was with some difficulty we wrenched our eyes from the more
        distant objects to contemplate the nearer ones. Mont Dauphin was very
        conspicuous, but La Bessée was not readily perceived. Besides these
        places not a habitation could be seen; all was rock, snow, or ice;
        and, large as we knew were the snow-fields of Dauphiné, we were
        surprised to find that they very far surpassed our most ardent
        imagination. Nearly in a line between us and the Viso, immediately to
        the south of Chateau Queyras, was a splendid group of mountains of
        great height. More to the south an unknown peak seemed still higher;
        while close to us we were astonished to discover that there was a
        mountain which appeared even higher than that on which we stood. At
        least this was my opinion; Macdonald thought that it was not so high,
        and Reynaud that it was much about the same elevation as our own
        peak.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This mountain was
        distant a couple of miles or so, and was separated from us by a
        tremendous abyss, the bottom of which we could not see. On the other
        side rose this mighty wall-sided peak, too steep for snow, black as
        night, with sharp ridges and pointed summit. We were in complete
        ignorance of its whereabouts, for none of us had been on the other
        side. We imagined that La Bérarde was in the abyss at our feet,
        although it was in reality beyond the other mountain.<a id=
        "noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class=

        id="page34">[pg 34]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We left the summit
        at last, and descended to the rocks and to our porter, where I boiled
        some water, obtained by melting snow. After we had fed, and smoked
        our cigars (lighted without difficulty from a common match), we found
        it was ten minutes past three, and high time to be off. We dashed,
        waded, and tumbled for twenty-five minutes through the snow, and then
        began the long descent of the rocks. It was nearly four o’clock, and,
        as it would be dark at eight, it was evident that there was no time
        to be lost, and we pushed on to the utmost. Nothing remarkable
        occurred going down. We kept rather closer to the glacier, and
        crossed at the same point as in the morning. Getting <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">off</span></span> it
        was like getting <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">on</span></span> it—rather awkward. Old Sémiond
        had got over—so had Reynaud; Macdonald came next, but, as he made a
        long stretch to get on to a higher mass, he slipped, and would have
        been in the bowels of a crevasse in a moment had he not been
        tied.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was nearly dark
        by the time we had crossed, yet I still hoped that we should be able
        to pass the night at our rock. Macdonald was not so sanguine, and he
        was right; for at last we found ourselves quite at fault, and
        wandered helplessly up and down for an hour, while Reynaud and the
        porter indulged in a little mutual abuse. The dreary fact, that, as
        we could not get down, we must stay where we were, was now quite
        apparent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We were at least
        10,500 feet high, and if it commenced to rain or snow, as the
        gathering clouds and rising wind seemed to threaten, we might be in a
        sore plight. We were hungry, having eaten little since 3 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span>, and a
        torrent we heard close at hand, but could not discover, aggravated
        our thirst. Sémiond endeavoured to get some water from it. Although
        he succeeded in doing so, he was wholly unable to return, and we had
        to solace him by shouting at intervals through the night.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A more detestable
        locality for a night out of doors it is difficult to imagine. There
        was not shelter of any kind; it was perfectly exposed to the chilly
        wind which began to rise, and it was too steep to promenade. Loose
        rubbly stones covered the ground, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page35">[pg 35]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>had to be removed before we could sit with any
        comfort. This was an advantage, although we hardly thought so at the
        time, as it gave us some employment, and, after an hour’s active
        exercise of that interesting kind, I obtained a small strip about
        nine feet long, on which it was possible to walk. Reynaud was furious
        at first, and soundly abused the porter, whose opinion as to the
        route down had been followed rather than that of our friend, and at
        last settled down to a deep dramatic despair, and wrung his hands
        with frantic gesture, as he exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh,
        malheur, malheur! Oh misérables!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thunder commenced
        to growl, and lightning to play among the peaks above, and the wind,
        which had brought the temperature down to nearly freezing-point,
        began to chill us to the bones. We examined our resources. They were
        six and a half cigars, two boxes of vesuvians, one-third of a pint of
        brandy-and-water, and half-a-pint of spirits of wine: rather scant
        fare for three fellows who had to get through seven hours before
        daylight. The spirit-lamp was lighted, and the remaining spirits of
        wine, the brandy and some snow, were heated by it. It was a strong
        liquor, and we wished for more of it. When it was consumed, Macdonald
        endeavoured to dry his socks by the lamp, and then the three lay down
        under my plaid to pretend to sleep. Reynaud’s woes were aggravated by
        toothache; Macdonald somehow managed to close his eyes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The longest night
        must end, and ours did at last. We got down to our rock in an hour
        and a quarter, and found the lad not a little surprised at our
        absence. He said he had made a gigantic fire to light us down, and
        shouted with all his might; we neither saw the fire nor heard his
        shouts. He said we looked a ghastly crew, and no wonder; it was our
        fourth night out.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We feasted at our
        cave, and performed some very necessary ablutions. The persons of the
        natives are infested by certain agile creatures—rapid of motion,
        numerous, and voracious. It is dangerous to approach too near, and
        one has to study the wind, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg
        36]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>so as
        to get on their weather-side. In spite of all such precautions my
        unfortunate companion and myself were being rapidly devoured alive.
        We only expected a temporary lull of our tortures, for the interiors
        of the inns are like the exteriors of the natives, swarming with this
        species of animated creation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is said that
        once, when these tormentors were filled with an unanimous desire, an
        unsuspecting traveller was dragged bodily from his bed! This needs
        confirmation. One word more, and I have done with this vile subject.
        We returned from our ablutions, and found the Frenchmen engaged in
        conversation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> said old Sémiond,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“as to fleas, I don’t pretend to be different
        to anyone else,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">I have them</span></span>.”</span> This time he
        certainly spoke the truth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We got down to La
        Ville in good time, and luxuriated there for several days; played
        many games of bowls with the natives, and were invariably beaten by
        them. At last it was necessary to part, and I walked to Abries, by
        way of Mont Dauphin and the gorge of the Guil towards Monte Viso,
        while Macdonald went to Briançon.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">
          &nbsp;
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have not
        attempted to conceal that the ascent of Mont Pelvoux is of a rather
        monotonous character; the view from its summit can, however, be
        confidently recommended. A glance at a map will show that, with the
        single exception of the Viso, whose position is unrivalled, it is
        better situated than any other mountain of considerable height for
        viewing the whole of the Western Alps.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our discovery that
        the peak which is to be called the Pointe des Ecrins was a separate
        and distinct mountain from Mont Pelvoux—and not its highest
        point—gave us satisfaction, although it was also rather of the nature
        of a disappointment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On our return to
        La Bessée we wrongly identified it with the peak which is seen from
        thence to the left of the Pelvoux. The two mountains bear a
        considerable resemblance to each other, so the mistake is not,
        perhaps, unpardonable. Although the latter <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page37">[pg 37]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>mountain is one that is considerably higher than
        the Wetterhorn or Monte Viso, it has no name; we called it the Pic
        Sans Nom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
        observed by others that it is improbable the French surveyors should
        have remained for several days upon the Pic de la Pyramide without
        visiting the other and loftier summit. If they did, it is strange
        that they did not leave some memorial of their visit. The natives who
        accompanied them asserted that they did not pass from one to the
        other; we therefore claimed to have made the ascent of the loftiest
        point for the first time. The claim, however, cannot be sustained, on
        account of the ascent of M. Puiseux. It is a matter of little moment;
        the excursion had for us all the interest of a first ascent; and I
        look back upon this, my first serious mountain scramble, with more
        satisfaction, and with as much pleasure as upon any that is recorded
        in this volume.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">
          &nbsp;
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days later,
        I left Abries to seek a quiet bundle of hay at Le Chalp—a village
        some miles nearer to the Viso. On approaching the place, the odour of
        sanctity became distinctly perceptible; and on turning a corner the
        cause was manifested—there was the priest of the place, surrounded by
        some of his flock. I advanced humbly, hat in hand, but almost before
        a word could be said, he broke out with, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who
        are you?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What are you?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What do you want?”</span> I endeavoured to
        explain. <span class="tei tei-q">“You are a deserter; I know you are
        a deserter; go away, you can’t stay here; go to Le Monta, down there;
        I won’t have you here,”</span> and he literally drove me away. The
        explanation of his strange behaviour was, that Piedmontese soldiers
        who were tired of the service had not unfrequently crossed the Col de
        la Traversette into the valley, and trouble had arisen from
        harbouring them. However, I did not know this at the time, and was
        not a little indignant that I, who was marching to the attack, should
        be taken for a deserter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So I walked away,
        and shortly afterwards, as it was getting <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>dark, encamped in a lovely hole—a cavity or kind
        of basin in the earth, with a stream on one side, a rock to windward,
        and some broken fir branches close at hand. Nothing could be more
        perfect: rock, hole, wood, and water. After making a roaring fire, I
        nestled in my blanket bag (an ordinary blanket sewn up double round
        the legs, with a piece of elastic riband round the open end), and
        slept, but not for long. I was troubled with dreams of the
        Inquisition; the tortures were being applied—priests were forcing
        fleas down my nostrils and into my eyes—and with red-hot pincers were
        taking out bits of flesh, and then cutting off my ears and tickling
        the soles of my feet. This was too much; I yelled a great yell and
        awoke, to find myself covered with innumerable crawling bodies. They
        were ants; I had camped by an ant-hill, and, after making its
        inhabitants mad with the fire, had coolly lain down in their
        midst.</p><a name="fig22" id="fig22" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The night was
        fine, and as I settled down in more comfortable quarters, a brilliant
        meteor sailed across full 60° of the cloudless <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sky, leaving a trail of light behind which
        lasted for several seconds. It was the herald of a splendid
        spectacle. Stars fell by hundreds; and not dimmed by intervening
        vapours, they sparkled with greater brightness than Sirius in our
        damp climate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next morning,
        after walking up the valley to examine the Viso, I returned to
        Abries, and engaged a man from a neighbouring hamlet, an inveterate
        smoker, and thirsty in proportion, whose pipe never left his mouth
        except to allow him to drink. We returned up the valley together, and
        slept in a hut of a shepherd, whose yearly wage was almost as small
        as that of the herdsman spoken of in Hyperion by Longfellow; and the
        next morning, in his company, proceeded to the summit of the pass
        which I had crossed in 1860. We were baffled in our attempt to get
        closer to the mountain. A deep notch<a id="noteref_29" name=
        "noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> with
        precipitous cliffs cut us off from it. The snow-slope, too, which
        existed in the preceding year on the Piedmontese side of the pass,
        was now wanting, and we were unable to descend the rocks which lay
        beneath. A fortnight afterwards the mountain was ascended for the
        first time by Messrs. Mathews and Jacomb, with the two Croz’s of
        Chamounix. Their attempt was made from the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">southern</span></span>
        side, and the ascent, which was formerly considered a thing totally
        impossible, has become one of the most common and favourite
        excursions of the district.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The night of the
        14th of August found me at St. Veran, a village made famous by Neff,
        but in no other respect remarkable, saving that it is one of the
        highest in Europe. The poor inn gave the impression of great poverty.
        There was no meat, no bread, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg
        40]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>no
        butter or cheese; almost the only things that could be obtained were
        eggs. The manners of the natives were primitive. The woman of the
        inn, without the least sense of impropriety, stayed in the room until
        I was fairly in bed, and her bill for supper, bed, and breakfast,
        amounted to one and sevenpence.</p><a name="fig23" id="fig23" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
        neighbourhood, and indeed all round about the Viso, the chamois still
        remain in considerable numbers. They said at St. Veran that six had
        been seen from the village on the day I was there, and the innkeeper
        declared that he had seen fifty together in the previous week! I
        myself saw in this and in the previous season several small companies
        round about the Viso. It is perhaps as favourable a district as any
        in the Alps for a sportsman who <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>wishes to hunt the chamois, as the ground over
        which they wander is by no means of excessive difficulty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day I
        descended the valley to Ville Vieille, and passed near the village of
        Molines, but on the opposite side of the valley, a remarkable natural
        pillar, in form not unlike a champagne bottle, about sixty feet high,
        which had been produced by the action of the weather, and, in all
        probability, chiefly by rain. These natural pillars are among the
        most remarkable examples of the potent effects produced by the
        long-continued action of quiet-working forces. They are found in
        several other places in the Alps, as well as elsewhere.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The village of
        Ville Vieille boasts of an inn with the sign of the Elephant; which,
        in the opinion of local amateurs, is a proof that Hannibal passed
        through the gorge of the Guil. I remember the place, because its
        bread, being only a month old, was unusually soft, and, for the first
        time during ten days, it was possible to eat some, without first of
        all chopping it into small pieces and soaking it in hot water, which
        produced a slimy paste on the outside, but left a hard untouched
        kernel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same day I
        crossed the Col Isoard to Briançon. It was the 15th of August, and
        all the world was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        natives in all degrees of inebriation staggered about the paths. It
        was late before the lights of the great fortress came into sight; but
        unchallenged I passed through the gates, and once more sought shelter
        under the roof of the Hotel de l’Ours.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two summits
        amongst those in the Alps which yet remained virgin had especially
        excited my admiration. One of these had been attacked numberless
        times by the best mountaineers without success; the other, surrounded
        by traditional inaccessibility, was almost untouched. These mountains
        were the Weisshorn and the Matterhorn.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After visiting the
        great tunnel of the Alps in 1861, I wandered for ten days in the
        neighbouring valleys, intending, presently, to attempt the ascent of
        these two peaks. Rumours were floating about that the former had been
        conquered, and that the latter was shortly to be attacked, and they
        were confirmed on arrival at Chatillon, at the entrance of the Val
        Tournanche. My interest in the Weisshorn consequently abated, but it
        was raised to the highest pitch on hearing that Professor Tyndall was
        at Breil, and intending to try to crown his first victory by another
        and still greater one.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up to this time my
        experience with guides had not been fortunate, and I was inclined,
        improperly, to rate them at a low value. They represented to me
        pointers out of paths, and large consumers of meat and drink, but
        little more; and, with the recollection of Mont Pelvoux, I should
        have greatly preferred the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg

        "tei tei-anchor"></a>company of a couple of my countrymen to any
        number of guides. In answer to inquiries at Chatillon, a series of
        men came forward, whose faces expressed malice, pride, envy, hatred,
        and roguery of every description, but who seemed to be destitute of
        all good qualities. The arrival of two gentlemen with a guide, who
        they represented was the embodiment of every virtue, and exactly the
        man for the Matterhorn, rendered it unnecessary to engage any of the
        others. My new guide in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">physique</span></span> was a combination of
        Chang and Anak; and although in acquiring him I did not obtain
        exactly what was wanted, his late employers did exactly what
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">they</span></span> wanted, for I obtained the
        responsibility, without knowledge, of paying his back fare, which
        must have been a relief at once to their minds and to their
        purses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When walking up

        inquired for another man of all the knowing ones, and they, with one
        voice, proclaimed that Jean-Antoine Carrel, of the village of Val
        Tournanche, was the cock of his valley. We sought, of course, for
        Carrel; and found him a well-made, resolute-looking fellow, with a
        certain defiant air which was rather taking. Yes, he would go. Twenty
        francs a day, whatever was the result, was his price. I assented. But
        I must take his comrade. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why so?”</span> Oh,
        it was absolutely impossible to get along without another man. As he
        said this, an evil countenance came forth out of the darkness and
        proclaimed itself the comrade. I demurred, the negotiations broke
        off, and we went up to Breil. This place will be frequently mentioned
        in subsequent chapters, and was in full view of the extraordinary
        peak, the ascent of which we were about to attempt.</p>

        which surround its base. They will know too that it was the last
        great Alpine peak which remained unscaled,—less on account of the
        difficulty of doing so, than from the terror inspired by its
        invincible appearance. There seemed to be a <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cordon</span></span>
        drawn around it, up to which one might go, but no farther. Within
        that invisible line gins and effreets were supposed to exist—the
        Wandering Jew and the spirits of the damned. The superstitious
        natives in the surrounding valleys (many of whom still firmly believe
        it to be not only the highest mountain in the Alps, but in the world)
        spoke of a ruined city on its summit wherein the spirits dwelt; and
        if you laughed, they gravely shook their heads; told you to look
        yourself to see the castles and the walls, and warned one against a
        rash approach, lest the infuriate demons from their impregnable
        heights might hurl down vengeance for one’s derision. Such were the
        traditions of the natives. Stronger minds felt the influence of the
        wonderful form, and men who ordinarily spoke or wrote like rational
        beings, when they came under its power seemed to quit their senses,
        and ranted, and rhapsodised, losing for a time all common forms of
        speech. Even the sober De Saussure was moved to enthusiasm when he
        saw the mountain, and—inspired by the spectacle—he anticipated the
        speculations of modern geologists, in the striking sentences which
        are placed at the head of this chapter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Matterhorn
        looks equally imposing from whatever side it is seen; it never seems
        commonplace; and in this respect, and in regard to the impression it
        makes upon spectators, it stands almost alone amongst mountains. It
        has no rivals in the Alps, and but few in the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The seven or eight
        thousand feet which compose the actual peak have several well-marked
        ridges and numerous others.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href=
        "#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> The most
        continuous is that which leads towards the north-east; the summit is
        at its higher, and the little peak, called the Hörnli, is at its
        lower end. Another one that is well-pronounced descends from
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name="Pg045"
        id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the summit to the ridge called
        the Furgen Grat. The slope of the mountain that is between these two
        ridges will be referred to as the eastern face. A third, somewhat
        less continuous than the others, descends in a south-westerly
        direction, and the portion of the mountain that is seen from Breil is
        confined to that which is comprised between this and the second
        ridge. This section is not composed, like that between the first and
        second ridge, of one grand face; but it is broken up into a series of
        huge precipices, spotted with snow-slopes, and streaked with
        snow-gullies. The other half of the mountain, facing the Z’Mutt
        glacier, is not capable of equally simple definition. There are
        precipices, apparent, but not actual; there are precipices absolutely
        perpendicular; there are precipices overhanging: there are glaciers,
        and there are hanging glaciers; there are glaciers which tumble great
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">séracs</span></span> over greater cliffs, whose
        débris, subsequently consolidated, becomes glacier again; there are
        ridges split by the frost, and washed by the rain and melted snow
        into towers and spires: while, everywhere, there are ceaseless sounds
        of action, telling that the causes are still in operation which have
        been at work since the world began; reducing the mighty mass to
        atoms, and effecting its degradation.</p><a name="plate02" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most tourists
        obtain their first view of the mountain either from the valley of
        Zermatt or from that of Tournanche. From the former direction the
        base of the mountain is seen at its narrowest, and its ridges and
        faces seem to be of prodigious steepness. The tourist toils up the
        valley, looking frequently for the great sight which is to reward his
        pains, without seeing it (for the mountain is first perceived in that
        direction about a mile to the north of Zermatt), when, all at once,
        as he turns a rocky corner of the path, it comes into view; not,
        however, where it is expected; the face has to be raised up to look
        at it; it seems overhead. Although this is the impression, the fact
        is that the summit of the Matterhorn from this point makes an angle
        with the eye of less than 16º, while the Dom, from the same place,
        makes a larger angle, but is passed by unobserved. So little can
        dependence be placed on unaided vision. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>The view of the mountain from Breil, in the Val
        Tournanche, is not less striking than that on the other side; but,
        usually, it makes less impression, because the spectator grows
        accustomed to the sight while coming up or down the valley. From this
        direction the mountain is seen to be broken up into a series of
        pyramidal wedge-shaped masses; on the other side it is remarkable for
        the large, unbroken extent of cliffs that it presents, and for the
        simplicity of its outline. It was natural to suppose that a way would
        more readily be found to the summit on a side thus broken up than in
        any other direction. The eastern face, fronting Zermatt, seemed one
        smooth, inaccessible cliff, from summit to base. The ghastly
        precipices which face the Z’Mutt glacier forbade any attempt in
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">that</span></span> direction. There remained
        only the side of Val Tournanche; and it will be found that nearly all
        the earliest attempts to ascend the mountain were made upon the
        southern side.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first efforts
        to ascend the Matterhorn of which I have heard, were made by the
        guides, or rather by the chasseurs, of Val Tournanche.<a id=

        attempts were made in the years 1858-9, from the direction of Breil,
        and the highest point that was attained was perhaps as far as the
        place which is now called the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Chimney”</span> (cheminée), a height of about 12,650
        feet. Those who were concerned in these expeditions were Jean-Antoine
        Carrel, Jean Jacques Carrel, Victor Carrel, the Abbé Gorret, and
        Gabrielle Maquignaz. I have been unable to obtain any further details
        respecting them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next attempt
        was a remarkable one; and of it, too, there is no published account.
        It was made by the Messrs. Alfred, Charles, and Sandbach Parker, of
        Liverpool, in July 1860. These gentlemen, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">without
        guides</span></span>, endeavoured to storm the citadel by attacking
        its eastern face<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href=
        "#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>—that to
        which reference was just now made as a smooth, impracticable cliff.
        Mr. Sandbach Parker <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg
        47]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>informs me that he and his brothers went along
        the ridge between the Hörnli and the peak until they came to the
        point where the ascending angle is considerably increased. This place
        is marked on Dufour’s map of Switzerland 3298 mètres (10,820 feet).
        They were then obliged to bear a little to the left to get on to the
        face of the mountain, and, afterwards, they turned to the right, and
        ascended about 700 feet farther, keeping as nearly as was practicable
        to the crest of the ridge, but, occasionally, bearing a little to the
        left—that is, more on to the face of the mountain. The brothers
        started from Zermatt, and did not sleep out. Clouds, a high wind, and
        want of time, were the causes which prevented these daring gentlemen
        from going farther. Thus, their highest point was under 12,000
        feet.</p><a name="plate03" id="plate03" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Hawkins had

        lead to the summit. He engaged J. Jacques Carrel, who was concerned
        in the first attempts, and, accompanied by Bennen (and by Professor
        Tyndall, whom he had invited to take part in the expedition), he
        started for the gap between the little and the great peak.<a id=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bennen was a guide
        who was beginning to be talked about. During the chief part of his
        brief career he was in the service of Wellig, the landlord of the inn
        on the Æggischhorn, and was hired out by him to tourists. Although
        his experience was limited, he had acquired a good reputation; and
        his book of certificates, which is lying before me,<a id="noteref_39"
        name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> shows
        that he was highly esteemed by his employers. A good-looking man,
        with courteous, gentlemanly manners, skilful and bold, he might, by
        this time, have taken a front place amongst guides if he had only
        been endowed with more prudence. He perished miserably, in the spring
        of 1864, not far from his home, on a mountain called the Haut de Cry,
        in the Valais.<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href=
        "#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Hawkins’
        party, led by Bennen, climbed the rocks abutting against the Couloir
        du Lion, on its south side, and attained the Col du Lion, although
        not without difficulty. They then followed the south-west ridge,
        passed the place at which the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page49">[pg 49]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>earliest explorers had turned back (the
        Chimney),<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href=
        "#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> and
        ascended about 300 feet more. Mr. Hawkins and J. J. Carrel then
        stopped, but Bennen and Professor Tyndall mounted a few feet higher.
        They retreated, however, in less than half-an-hour, finding that
        there was too little time; and, descending to the Col by the same
        route as they had followed on the ascent, proceeded thence to Breil,
        down the Couloir instead of by the rocks. The point at which Mr.
        Hawkins stopped is easily identified from his description. Its height
        is 12,992 feet above the sea. I think that Bennen and Tyndall could
        not have ascended more than 50 or 60 feet beyond this in the few
        minutes they were absent from the others, as they were upon one of
        the most difficult parts of the mountain. This party therefore
        accomplished an advance of about 350 or 400 feet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Hawkins did
        not, as far as I know, make another attempt; and the next was made by
        the Messrs. Parker, in July 1861. They again started from Zermatt;
        followed the route they had struck out on the previous year, and got
        a little higher than before; but they were defeated by want of time,
        shortly afterwards left Zermatt on account of bad weather, and did
        not again renew their attempts. Mr. Parker says—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In neither case did we go as high as we could. At the
        point where we turned we saw our way for a few hundred feet farther;
        but, beyond that, the difficulties seemed to increase.”</span> I am
        informed that both attempts should be considered as excursions
        undertaken with the view of ascertaining whether there was any
        encouragement to make a more deliberate attack on the north-east
        side.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My guide and I
        arrived at Breil on the 28th of August 1861, and we found that
        Professor Tyndall <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">had</span></span> been there a day or two
        before, but had done nothing. I had seen the mountain from nearly
        every direction, and it seemed, even to a novice like myself, far too
        much for a single day. I intended to sleep out upon it, as
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span><a name="Pg050"
        id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>high as possible, and to
        attempt to reach the summit on the following day. We endeavoured to
        induce another man to accompany us, but without success. Matthias zum
        Taugwald and other well-known guides were there at the time, but they
        declined to go on any account. A sturdy old fellow—Peter Taugwalder
        by name—said he would go! His price? <span class="tei tei-q">“Two
        hundred francs.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What, whether we
        ascend or not?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—nothing
        less.”</span> The end of the matter was, that all the men who were
        more or less capable showed a strong disinclination, or positively
        refused, to go (their disinclination being very much in proportion to
        their capacity), or else asked a prohibitive price. This, it may be
        said once for all, was the reason why so many futile attempts were
        made upon the Matterhorn. One first-rate guide after another was
        brought up to the mountain, and patted on the back, but all declined
        the business. The men who went had no heart in the matter, and took
        the first opportunity to turn back.<a id="noteref_42" name=

        were, with the exception of one man, to whom reference will be made
        presently, universally impressed with the belief that the summit was
        entirely inaccessible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We resolved to go
        alone, and anticipating a cold bivouac, begged the loan of a couple
        of blankets from the innkeeper. He refused them; giving the curious
        reason, that we had bought a bottle of brandy at Val Tournanche, and
        had not bought any from him! No brandy, no blankets, appeared to be
        his rule. We did not require them that night, as it was passed in the
        highest cow-shed in the valley, which is about an hour nearer to the
        mountain than is the hotel. The cowherds, worthy fellows, seldom
        troubled by tourists, hailed our company with delight, and did their
        best to make us comfortable; brought out their little stores of
        simple food, and, as we sat with them round the great copper pot
        which hung over the fire, bade us in husky voice, but with honest
        intent, to beware of the perils of the haunted cliffs. When night was
        coming on, we saw, stealing up the hill-side, the forms of
        Jean-Antoine Carrel and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg

        and had a strong inclination to engage the pair; but, finally,
        decided against it. The comrade turned out to be the J. J. Carrel who
        had been with Mr. Hawkins, and was nearly related to the other
        man.</p><a name="fig25" id="fig25" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        mountaineers; but Jean-Antoine was incomparably the better man of the
        two, and he is the finest rock-climber I have ever seen. He was the
        only man who persistently refused to accept defeat, and who continued
        to believe, in spite of all discouragements, that the great mountain
        was not inaccessible, and that it could be ascended from the side of
        his native valley.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The night wore
        away without any excitement, except from the fleas, a party of whom
        executed a spirited fandango on my cheek, to the sound of music
        produced on the drum of my ear, by one of their fellows beating with
        a wisp of hay. The two Carrels crept <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>noiselessly out before daybreak, and went off.
        We did not start until nearly seven o’clock, and followed them
        leisurely, leaving all our properties in the cow-shed; sauntered over
        the gentian-studded slopes which intervene between the shed and the
        Glacier du Lion, left cows and their pastures behind, traversed the
        stony wastes, and arrived at the ice. Old, hard beds of snow lay on
        its right bank (our left hand), and we mounted over them on to the
        lower portion of the glacier with ease. But, as we ascended,
        crevasses became numerous, and we were at last brought to a halt by
        some which were of very large dimensions; and, as our cutting powers
        were limited, we sought an easier route, and turned, naturally, to
        the lower rocks of the Tête du Lion, which overlook the glacier on
        its west. Some good scrambling took us in a short time on to the
        crest of the ridge which descends towards the south; and thence, up
        to the level of the Col du Lion, there was a long natural staircase,
        on which it was seldom necessary to use the hands. We dubbed the
        place <span class="tei tei-q">“The Great Staircase.”</span> Then the
        cliffs of the Tête du Lion, which rise above the Couloir, had to be
        skirted. This part varies considerably in different seasons, and in
        1861 we found it difficult; for the fine steady weather of that year
        had reduced the snow-beds abutting against it to a lower level than
        usual, and the rocks which were left exposed at the junction of the
        snow with the cliffs, had few ledges or cracks to which we could
        hold. But by half-past ten o’clock we stood on the Col, and looked
        down upon the magnificent basin out of which the Z’Mutt glacier
        flows. We decided to pass the night upon the Col, for we were charmed
        with the capabilities of the place, although it was one where
        liberties could not be taken. On one side a sheer wall overhung the
        Tiefenmatten glacier. On the other, steep, glassy slopes of hard snow
        descended to the Glacier du Lion, furrowed by water and by falling
        stones. On the north there was the great peak of the
        Matterhorn,<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href=
        "#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        the south the cliffs of the Tête du Lion. Throw <span class=

        come from that side. Neither could it from the other. Nor was it
        likely that it would from the Tête du Lion, for some jutting ledges
        conveniently overhung our proposed resting-place. We waited for a
        while, basked in the sunshine, and watched <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page54">[pg 54]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>or listened to the Carrels, who were sometimes
        seen or heard, high above us, upon the ridge leading towards the
        summit; and, leaving at mid-day, we descended to the cow-shed, packed
        up the tent and other properties, and returned to the Col, although
        heavily laden, before six o’clock. This tent was constructed on a
        pattern suggested by Mr. Francis Galton, and it was not a success. It
        looked very pretty when set up in London, but it proved thoroughly
        useless in the Alps. It was made of light canvas, and opened like a
        book; had one end closed permanently and the other with flaps; it was
        supported by two alpenstocks, and had the canvas sides prolonged so
        as to turn in underneath. Numerous cords were sewn to the lower
        edges, to which stones were to be attached; but the main fastenings
        were by a cord which passed underneath the ridge and through iron
        rings screwed into the tops of the alpenstocks, and were secured by
        pegs. The wind, which playfully careered about the surrounding
        cliffs, was driven through our gap with the force of a blow-pipe; the
        flaps of the tent would not keep down, the pegs would not stay in,
        and it exhibited so marked a desire to go to the top of the Dent
        Blanche, that we thought it prudent to take it down and to sit upon
        it. When night came on we wrapped ourselves in it, and made our camp
        as comfortable as the circumstances would allow. The silence was
        impressive. No living thing was near our solitary bivouac; the
        Carrels had turned back and were out of hearing; the stones had
        ceased to fall, and the trickling water to murmur—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was bitterly
        cold. Water froze hard in a bottle under my head. Not surprising, as
        we were actually on snow, and in a position where the slightest wind
        was at once felt. For a time we dozed, but about midnight there came
        from high aloft a tremendous <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg
        55]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>explosion, followed by a second of dead quiet. A
        great mass of rock had split off, and was descending towards us. My
        guide started up, wrung his hands, and exclaimed, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“O my God, we are lost!”</span> We heard it coming, mass
        after mass pouring over the precipices, bounding and rebounding from
        cliff to cliff, and the great rocks in advance smiting one another.
        They seemed to be close, although they were probably distant, but
        some small fragments, which dropped upon us at the same time from the
        ledges just above, added to the alarm, and my demoralised companion
        passed the remainder of the night in a state of shudder, ejaculating
        <span class="tei tei-q">“terrible,”</span> and other adjectives.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We put ourselves
        in motion at daybreak, and commenced the ascent of the south-west
        ridge. There was no more sauntering with hands in the pockets; each
        step had to be earned by downright climbing. But it was the most
        pleasant kind of climbing. The rocks were fast and unencumbered with
        débris; the cracks were good, although not numerous, and there was
        nothing to fear except from one’s-self. So we thought, at least, and
        shouted to awake echoes from the cliffs. Ah! there is no response.
        Not yet; wait a while, everything here is upon a superlative scale;
        count a dozen, and then the echoes will return from the walls of the
        Dent d’Hérens, miles away, in waves of pure and undefiled sound;
        soft, musical, and sweet. Halt a moment to regard the view! We
        overlook the Tête du Lion, and nothing except the Dent d’Hérens,
        whose summit is still a thousand feet above us, stands in the way.
        The ranges of the Graian Alps—an ocean of mountains—are seen, at a
        glance, governed by their three great peaks, the Grivola, Grand
        Paradis, and Tour de St. Pierre. How soft, and yet how sharp, they
        look in the early morning! The mid-day mists have not begun to rise;
        nothing is obscured; even the pointed Viso, all but a hundred miles
        away, is perfectly defined.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Turn to the east,
        and watch the sun’s slanting rays coming across the Monte Rosa
        snow-fields. Look at the shadowed parts, and see how even
        they—radiant with reflected light—are more <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page56">[pg 56]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>brilliant than man knows how to depict. See,
        how—even there—the gentle undulations give shadows within shadows;
        and how—yet again—where falling stones or ice have left a track,
        there are shadows upon shadows, each with a light and a dark side,
        with infinite gradations of matchless tenderness. Then, note the
        sunlight as it steals noiselessly along, and reveals countless
        unsuspected forms;—the delicate ripple-lines which mark the concealed
        crevasse, and the waves of drifted snow; producing each minute more
        lights and fresh shadows; sparkling on the edges and glittering on
        the ends of the icicles; shining on the heights and illuminating the
        depths, until all is aglow, and the dazzled eye returns for relief to
        the sombre crags.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hardly an hour had
        passed since we left the Col before we arrived at the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Chimney.”</span> It proved to be the counterpart of the
        place to which reference has been made at <a href="#Pg003" class=
        "tei tei-ref">p. 3</a>; a smooth, straight slab of rock was fixed, at
        a considerable angle, between two others equally smooth.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> My
        companion essayed to go up, and, after crumpling his long body into
        many ridiculous positions, he said that he would not, for he could
        not, do it. With some little trouble I got up it unassisted, and then
        my guide tied himself on to the end of our rope, and I endeavoured to
        pull him up. But he was so awkward that he did little for himself,
        and so heavy that he proved too much for me, and after several
        attempts he untied himself, and quietly observed that he should go
        down. I told him he was a coward, and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></span>
        mentioned his opinion of me. I requested him to go to Breil, and to
        say that he had left his <span class="tei tei-q">“monsieur”</span> on
        the mountain, and he turned to go; whereupon I had to eat humble pie
        and ask him to come back; for, although it was not very difficult to
        go up, and not at all dangerous with a man standing below, it was
        quite another thing to come down, as the lower edge overhung in a
        provoking manner.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day was
        perfect; the sun was pouring down grateful <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page57">[pg 57]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>warmth; the wind had fallen; the way seemed
        clear, no insuperable obstacle was in sight; yet what could one do
        alone? I stood on the top, chafing under this unexpected contretemps,
        and remained for some time irresolute; but as it became apparent that
        the Chimney was swept more frequently than was necessary (it was a
        natural channel for falling stones), I turned at last, descended with
        the assistance of my companion, and returned with him to Breil, where
        we arrived about mid-day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Carrels did
        not show themselves, but we were told that they had not got to any
        great height,<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href=

        the <span class="tei tei-q">“comrade,”</span> who for convenience had
        taken off his shoes and tied them round his waist, had managed to let
        one of them slip, and had come down with a piece of cord fastened
        round his naked foot. Notwithstanding this, they had boldly glissaded
        down the Couloir du Lion, J. J. Carrel having his shoeless foot tied
        up in a pocket handkerchief.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Matterhorn was
        not assailed again in 1861. I left Breil with the conviction that it
        was little use for a single tourist to organise an attack upon it, so

        that it was desirable at least two should go, to back each other when

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The year 1862 was
        still young, and the Matterhorn, clad in its wintry garb, bore but
        little resemblance to the Matterhorn of the summer, when a new force
        came to do battle with the mountain, from another direction. Mr. T.
        S. Kennedy of Leeds conceived the extraordinary idea that the peak
        might prove less impracticable in January than in June, and arrived
        at Zermatt in the former month to put his conception to the test.
        With stout Peter Perrn and sturdy Peter Taugwalder he slept in the
        little chapel at the Schwarzensee, and on the next morning, like the
        Messrs. Parker, followed the ridge between the peak called Hörnli and
        the great mountain. But they found that snow in winter obeyed the
        ordinary laws, and that the wind and frost were not less unkind than
        in summer. <span class="tei tei-q">“The wind whirled up the snow and
        spiculæ of ice into our faces like needles, and flat pieces of ice a
        foot in diameter, carried up from the glacier below, went flying
        past. Still no one seemed to like to be the first to give in, till a
        gust fiercer than usual forced us to shelter for a time behind a
        rock. Immediately it was tacitly understood that our expedition must
        now end; but we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg
        59]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>determined to leave some memento of our visit,
        and, after descending a considerable distance, we found a suitable
        place with loose stones of which to build a cairn. In half-an-hour a
        tower six feet high was erected; a bottle, with the date, was placed
        inside, and we retreated as rapidly as possible.”</span><a id=
        "noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> This
        cairn was placed at the spot marked upon Dufour’s Map of Switzerland
        10,820 feet (3298 mètres), and the highest point attained by Mr.
        Kennedy was not, I imagine, more than two or three hundred feet above
        it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shortly after this
        Professor Tyndall gave, in his little tract <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mountaineering in
        1861</span></span>, an account of the reason why he had left Breil,
        in August 1861, without doing anything.<a id="noteref_49" name=
        "noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> It seems
        that he sent his guide Bennen to reconnoitre, and that the latter
        made the following report to his employer:—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Herr, I have examined the mountain carefully, and find
        it more difficult and dangerous than I had imagined. There is no
        place upon it where we could well pass the night. We might do so on
        yonder Col upon the snow, but there we should be almost frozen to
        death, and totally unfit for the work of the next day. On the rocks
        there is no ledge or cranny which could give us proper harbourage;
        and starting from Breuil it is certainly impossible to reach the
        summit in a single day.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I was
        entirely taken aback,”</span> says Tyndall, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“by this report. I felt like a man whose grip had given
        way, and who was dropping through the air.... Bennen was evidently
        dead against any attempt upon the mountain. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘We can, at all events, reach the lower of the two
        summits,’</span> I remarked. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Even that is
        difficult,’</span> he replied; <span class="tei tei-q">‘but when you
        have reached it, what then? The peak has neither name nor
        fame.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href=
        "#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was more
        surprised than discouraged by this report by Bennen. One half of his
        assertions I knew to be wrong. The Col to which he referred was the
        Col du Lion, upon which we had passed a night less than a week after
        he had spoken so authoritatively; and I had seen a place not far
        below the <span class="tei tei-q">“Chimney,”</span>—a place about 500
        feet above the Col—where it seemed possible to construct a
        sleeping-place. Bennen’s opinions seem to have undergone a complete
        change. In 1860 he is described as having been enthusiastic to make
        an attempt, and in 1861 he was dead against one. Nothing dismayed by
        this, my friend Mr. Reginald Macdonald, our companion on the
        Pelvoux—to whom so much of our success had been due, agreed to join
        me in a renewed assault from the south; and, although we failed to
        secure Melchior Anderegg and some other notable guides, we obtained
        two men of repute, namely, Johann zum Taugwald and Johann Kronig, of
        Zermatt. We met at that place early in July, but stormy weather
        prevented us even from passing to the other side of the chain for
        some time. We crossed the Col Théodule on the 5th, in thoroughly
        unsettled weather—rain was falling in the valleys, and snow upon the
        mountains. Shortly before we gained the summit we were made extremely
        uncomfortable by hearing mysterious, rushing sounds, which sometimes
        seemed as if a sudden gust of wind was sweeping along the snow, and,
        at others, almost like the swishing of a long whip: yet the snow
        exhibited no signs of motion, and the air was perfectly calm. The
        dense, black storm-clouds made us momentarily expect that our bodies
        might be used as lightning-conductors, and we were well satisfied to
        get under shelter of the inn at Breil, without having submitted to
        any such experience.<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href=
        "#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We had need of a
        porter, and, by the advice of our landlord, descended to the chalets
        of Breil in search of one Luc Meynet. We found his house a mean
        abode, encumbered with cheese-making apparatus, and tenanted only by
        some bright-eyed children; but as they said that uncle Luc would soon
        be home, we waited at the door of the little chalet and watched for
        him. At last a speck was seen coming round the corner of the patch of
        firs below Breil, and then the children clapped their hands, dropped
        their toys, and ran eagerly forward to meet him. We saw an ungainly,
        wobbling figure stoop down and catch up the little ones, kiss them on
        each cheek, and put them into the empty panniers on each side of the
        mule, and then heard it come on carolling, as if this was not a world
        of woe: and yet the face of little Luc Meynet, the hunchback of
        Breil, bore traces of trouble and sorrow, and there was more than a
        touch of sadness in his voice when he said that he must look after
        his brother’s children. All his difficulties were, however, at length
        overcome, and he agreed to join us to carry the tent.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">
          &nbsp;
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the past winter
        I had turned my attention to tents, and that which we had brought
        with us was the result of experiments to devise one which should be
        sufficiently portable to be taken over the most difficult ground, and
        which should combine lightness with stability. Its base was just
        under six feet square, and a cross-section perpendicular to its
        length was an equilateral triangle, the sides of which were six feet
        long. It was intended to accommodate four persons. It was supported
        by four ash-poles, six feet and a half long, and one inch and a
        quarter thick, tapering to the top to an inch and an eighth; these
        were shod with iron points. The order of proceeding in the
        construction of the tent was as follows:—Holes were drilled through
        the poles about five inches from their tops, for the insertion of two
        wrought-iron bolts, three inches long <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page62">[pg 62]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>and one quarter of an inch thick. The bolts were
        then inserted, and the two pairs of poles were set out (and fixed up
        by cords), to the proper dimensions. The roof was then put on. This
        was made of the rough, unbleached calico called forfar, which can be
        obtained in six-feet widths, and it was continued round for about two
        feet, on each side, on to the floor. The width of the material was
        the length of the tent, and seams were thus avoided in the roof. The
        forfar was sewn round each pole; particular care being taken to avoid
        wrinkles, and to get the whole perfectly taut. The flooring was next
        put in and sewn down to the forfar. This was of the ordinary plaid
        mackintosh, about nine feet square; the surplus three feet being
        continued up the sides to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg
        63]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>prevent draughts. It is as well to have two feet
        of this surplus on one side, and only one foot on the other; the
        latter amount being sufficient for the side occupied by the feet. One
        end was then permanently closed by a triangular piece of forfar,
        which was sewn down to that which was already fixed. The other end
        was left open, and had two triangular flaps that overlapped each
        other, and which were fastened up when we were inside by pieces of
        tape. Lastly, the forfar was nailed down to the poles to prevent the
        tent getting out of shape. The cord which was used for climbing
        served for the tent; it was passed over the crossed poles and
        underneath the ridge of the roof, and the two ends—one fore and the
        other aft—were easily secured to pieces of rock. Such a tent costs
        about four guineas, and its weight is about twenty-three pounds; or,
        if the lightest kind of forfar is used, it need not exceed twenty
        pounds. When it was fastened up for transport it presented the
        appearance shown in the portrait of Meynet at <a href="#fig66" class=
        "tei tei-ref">p. 234</a>, and it could be unrolled and set up by two
        persons in three minutes; a point of no small importance during
        extreme weather.</p><a name="fig27" id="fig27" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This tent is
        intended, and adapted, for camping out at high altitudes, or in cold
        climates. It is not pretended that it is perfectly waterproof, but it
        can be made so by the addition of mackintosh to the roof; and this
        increases the weight by only two and a half pounds. It is then fit
        for general use.<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href=

        be observed that the pattern of this tent is identical in all
        essential points with that arrived at (after great experience) by Sir
        Leopold M’Clintock for Arctic work, and frequent use by many persons,
        under varied conditions, has shown that the pattern is both practical
        and substantial.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page64">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sunday, the 6th of
        July, was showery, and snow fell on the Matterhorn, but we started on
        the following morning with our three men, and pursued my route of the
        previous year. I was requested to direct the way, as none save myself
        had been on the mountain before. I did not distinguish myself upon
        this occasion, and led my companions nearly to the top of the small
        peak before the mistake was discovered. The party becoming
        rebellious, a little exploration was made towards our right, and we
        found that we were upon the top of the cliff overlooking the Col du
        Lion. The upper part of the small peak is of a very different
        character to the lower part; the rocks are not so firm, and they are
        usually covered, or intermixed, with snow, and glazed with ice: the
        angle too is more severe. While descending a small snow-slope, to get
        on to the right track, Kronig slipped on a streak of ice, and went
        down at a fearful pace. Fortunately he kept on his legs, and, by a
        great effort, succeeded in stopping just before he arrived at some
        rocks that jutted through the snow, which would infallibly have
        knocked him over. When we rejoined him a few minutes later, we found
        that he was incapable of standing, much less of moving, with a face
        corpse-like in hue, and trembling violently. He remained in this
        condition for more than an hour, and the day was consequently far
        advanced before we arrived at our camping-place on the Col. Profiting
        by the experience of last year, we did not pitch the tent actually on
        the snow, but collected a quantity of débris from the neighbouring
        ledges, and after constructing a rough platform of the larger pieces,
        levelled the whole with the dirt and mud.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meynet had proved
        invaluable as a tent-bearer; for—although his legs were more
        picturesque than symmetrical, and although he seemed to be built on
        principle with no two parts alike—his very deformities proved of
        service; and we quickly found he had spirit of no common order, and
        that few peasants are more agreeable companions, or better climbers,
        than little Luc Meynet, the hunchback of Breil. He now showed himself
        not less serviceable as a scavenger, and humbly asked for gristly
        pieces of meat, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page65">[pg
        65]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>rejected by the others, or for suspicious eggs;
        and seemed to consider it a peculiar favour, if not a treat, to be
        permitted to drink the coffee-grounds. With the greatest contentment
        he took the worst place at the door of the tent, and did all the
        dirty work which was put upon him by the guides, as gratefully as a
        dog—who has been well beaten—will receive a stroke.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A strong wind
        sprang up from the east during the night, and in the morning it was
        blowing almost a hurricane. The tent behaved nobly, and we remained
        under its shelter for several hours after the sun had risen,
        uncertain what it was best to do. A lull tempted us to move, but we
        had scarcely ascended a hundred feet before the storm burst upon us
        with increased fury. Advance or return was alike impossible; the
        ridge was denuded of its débris; and we clutched our hardest when we
        saw stones as big as a man’s fist blown away horizontally into space.
        We dared not attempt to stand upright, and remained stationary, on
        all fours, glued, as it were, to the rocks. It was intensely cold,
        for the blast had swept along the main chain of the Pennine Alps, and
        across the great snow-fields around Monte Rosa. Our warmth and
        courage rapidly evaporated, and at the next lull we retreated to the
        tent; having to halt several times even in that short distance.
        Taugwald and Kronig then declared that they had had enough, and
        refused to have anything more to do with the mountain. Meynet also
        informed us that he would be required down below for important
        cheese-making operations on the following day. It was therefore
        needful to return to Breil, and we arrived there at 2.30 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span>,
        extremely chagrined at our complete defeat.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jean-Antoine
        Carrel, attracted by rumours, had come up to the inn during our
        absence, and after some negotiations agreed to accompany us, with one
        of his friends named Pession, on the first fine day. We thought
        ourselves fortunate; for Carrel clearly considered the mountain a
        kind of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">preserve</span></span>, and regarded our late
        attempt as an act of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">poaching</span></span>. The wind blew itself out
        during the night, and we started again, with these two men and a
        porter, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg 66]</span><a name=
        "Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at 8 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> on the
        9th, with unexceptionable weather. Carrel pleased us by suggesting
        that we should camp even higher than before; and we accordingly
        proceeded, without resting at the Col, until we overtopped the Tête
        du Lion. Near the foot of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Chimney,”</span> a little below the crest of the ridge,
        and on its eastern side, we found a protected place; and by building
        up from ledge to ledge (under the direction of our leader, who was a
        mason by profession), we at length constructed a platform of
        sufficient size and of considerable solidity. Its height was about
        12,550 feet above the sea; and it exists, I believe, at the present
        time.<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href=
        "#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> We then
        pushed on, as the day was very fine, and, after a short hour’s
        scramble, got to the foot of the Great Tower upon the ridge (that is
        to say, to Mr. Hawkins’ farthest point), and afterwards returned to
        our bivouac. We turned out again at 4 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span>, and at
        5.15 started upwards once more, with fine weather and the thermometer
        at 28°. Carrel scrambled up the Chimney, and Macdonald and I after
        him. Pession’s turn came, but when he arrived at the top he looked
        very ill, declared himself to be thoroughly incapable, and said that
        he must go back. We waited some time, but he did not get better,
        neither could we learn the nature of his illness. Carrel flatly
        refused to go on with us alone. We were helpless. Macdonald, ever the
        coolest of the cool, suggested that we should try what we could do
        without them; but our better judgment prevailed, and, finally, we
        returned together to Breil. On the next day my friend started for
        London.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three times I had
        essayed the ascent of this mountain, and on each occasion had failed
        ignominiously. I had not advanced a yard beyond my predecessors. Up
        to the height of nearly 13,000 feet there were no extraordinary
        difficulties; the way so far might even become <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a matter of amusement.”</span> Only 1800 feet remained;
        but they were as yet untrodden, and might present the most
        for<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg067"
        id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>midable obstacles. No man could
        expect to climb them by himself. A morsel of rock only seven feet
        high might at any time defeat him, if it were perpendicular. Such a
        place might be possible to two, or a bagatelle to three men. It was
        evident that a party should consist of three men at least. But where
        could the other two men be obtained? Carrel was the only man who
        exhibited any enthusiasm in the matter; and he, in 1861, had
        absolutely refused to go unless the party consisted of at least
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        of the better men, however, could be induced to come, and I returned
        to Breil on the 17th, hoping to combine the skill of Carrel with the
        willingness of Meynet on a new attempt, by the same route as before;
        for the Hörnli ridge, which I had examined in the meantime, seemed to
        be entirely impracticable. Both men were inclined to go, but their
        ordinary occupations prevented them from starting at once.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My tent had been
        left rolled up at the second platform, and whilst waiting for the men
        it occurred to me that it might have been blown away during the late
        stormy weather; so I started off on the 18th to see if this were so
        or not. The way was by this time familiar, and I mounted rapidly,
        astonishing the friendly herdsmen—who nodded recognition as I flitted
        past them and the cows—for I was alone, because no man was available.
        But more deliberation was necessary when the pastures were passed,
        and climbing began, for it was needful to mark each step, in case of
        mist, or surprise by night. It is one of the few things which can be
        said in favour of mountaineering alone (a practice which has little
        besides to commend it), that it awakens a man’s faculties, and makes
        him observe. When one has no arms to help, and no head to guide him
        except his own, he must needs take note even of small things,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg068"
        id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for he cannot afford to throw
        away a chance; and so it came to pass, upon my solitary scramble,
        when above the snow-line, and beyond the ordinary limits of flowering
        plants, when peering about, noting angles and landmarks, that my eyes
        fell upon the tiny straggling plants—oftentimes a single flower on a
        single stalk—pioneers of vegetation, atoms of life in a world of
        desolation, which had found their way up—who can tell how?—from far
        below, and were obtaining bare sustenance from the scanty soil in
        protected nooks; and it gave a new interest to the well-known rocks
        to see what a gallant fight the survivors made (for many must have
        perished in the attempt) to ascend the great mountain. The Gentian,
        as one might have expected, was there; but it was run close by
        Saxifrages, and by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Linaria alpina</span></span>, and was beaten by
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thlaspi
        rotundifolium</span></span>, which latter plant was the highest I was
        able to secure, although it too was overtopped by a little white
        flower which I knew not, and was unable to reach.<a id="noteref_56"

        although snowed up; and I turned to con<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>template the view, which, when seen alone and
        undisturbed, had all the strength and charm of complete novelty. The
        highest peaks of the Pennine chain were in front—the Breithorn
        (13,685 feet), the Lyskamm (14,889), and Monte Rosa (15,217); then,
        turning to the right, the entire block of mountains which separated
        the Val Tournanche from the Val d’Ayas was seen at a glance, with its
        dominating summit the Grand Tournalin (11,155). Behind were the
        ranges dividing the Val d’Ayas from the Valley of Gressoney, backed
        by higher summits. More still to the right, the eye wandered down the
        entire length of the Val Tournanche, and then rested upon the Graian
        Alps with their innumerable peaks, and upon the isolated pyramid of
        Monte Viso (12,643) in the extreme distance. Next, still turning to
        the right, came the mountains <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page70">[pg 70]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>intervening between the Val Tournanche and the
        Val Barthélemy: Mont Rouss (a round-topped snowy summit, which seems
        so important from Breil, but which is in reality only a buttress of
        the higher mountain, the Château des Dames), had long ago sunk, and
        the eye passed over it, scarcely heeding its existence, to the Becca
        Salle (or, as it is sometimes called, Bec de Sale),—a miniature
        Matterhorn—and to other, and more important heights. Then the grand
        mass of the Dent d’Hérens (13,714) stopped the way; a noble mountain,
        encrusted on its northern slopes with enormous hanging glaciers,
        which broke away at mid-day in immense slices, and thundered down on
        to the Tiefenmatten glacier; and lastly, most splendid of all, came
        the Dent Blanche (14,318), soaring above the basin of the great
        Z’Muttgletscher. Such a view is hardly to be excelled in the Alps,
        and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        I saw it, perfectly unclouded.<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Time sped away
        unregarded, and the little birds which had built their nests on the
        neighbouring cliffs had begun to chirp their evening hymn before I
        thought of returning. Half mechanically I turned to the tent,
        unrolled it, and set it up; it contained food enough for several
        days, and I resolved to stay over the night. I had started from Breil
        without provisions, or telling Favre—the innkeeper, who was
        accustomed to my erratic ways—where I was going. I returned to the
        view. The sun was setting, and its rosy rays, blending with the snowy
        blue, had thrown a pale, pure violet far as the eye could see; the
        valleys were drowned in purple gloom, whilst the summits shone with
        unnatural brightness: and as I sat in the door of the tent, and
        watched the twilight change to darkness, the earth seemed to become
        less earthy and almost sublime; the world seemed dead, and I, its
        sole inhabitant. By and by, the moon as it rose brought the hills
        again into sight, and by a judicious repression of detail rendered
        the view yet more magnificent. Something in the south hung like a
        great glow-worm in the air; it was too large for a star, and too
        steady for a meteor; and it was long before I could realise the
        incredible fact that it was the moonlight glittering on the great
        snow-slope on the north side of Monte Viso, at a distance, as the
        crow flies, of 98 miles. Shivering, at last I entered the tent and
        made my coffee. The night was passed comfortably, and the next
        morning, tempted by the brilliancy of the weather, I proceeded yet
        higher in search of another place for a platform.</p><span class=

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/illus099.png" alt="Illustration: Climbing claw" /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Solitary
        scrambling over a pretty wide area had shown me that a single
        individual is subjected to many difficulties which do not trouble a
        party of two or three men, and that the disadvantages of being alone
        are more felt while descending than during the ascent. In order to
        neutralise these inconveniences, I devised two little appliances,
        which were now brought into use for the first time. One was a claw—a
        kind of grapnel—about five inches long, made of shear steel,
        one-fifth of an inch thick. This was of use in difficult places,
        where there was no hold within arm’s length, but where there were
        cracks or ledges some distance higher. The claw could be stuck on the
        end of the alpenstock and dropped into such places, or, on extreme
        occasions, flung up until it attached itself to something. The edges
        that laid hold of the rocks were serrated, which tended to make them
        catch more readily: the other end had a ring to which a rope was
        fastened. It must not be understood that this was employed for
        hauling one’s-self up for any great distance, but that it was used in
        ascending, at the most, for only a few yards at a time. In
        descending, however, it could be prudently used for a greater
        distance at a time, as the claws could be planted firmly; but it was
        necessary to keep the rope taut, and the pull constantly in the
        direction of the length of the implement, otherwise it had a tendency
        to slip away. The second device was merely a modification of a dodge
        practised by all climbers. It is frequently necessary for a single
        man (or for the last man of a party) during a descent, to make a loop
        in the end of his rope, to pass it over some rocks, and to come down
        holding the free end. The loop is then jerked off, and the process
        may be repeated. But as it sometimes happens that there are no rocks
        at hand which will allow a loose loop to be used, a slip-knot has to
        be resorted to, and the rope is drawn in tightly. Consequently it
        will occur that it is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg
        73]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not
        possible to jerk the loop off, and the rope has to be cut and left
        behind. To prevent this, I had a wrought-iron ring (two and a quarter
        inches in diameter and three-eighths of an inch thick) attached to
        one end of my rope. A loop could be made in a moment by passing the
        other end of the rope through this ring, which of course slipped up
        and held tightly as I descended holding the free end. A strong piece
        of cord was also attached to the ring, and, on arriving at the
        bottom, this was pulled; the ring slid back again, and the loop was
        whipped off readily. By means of these two simple appliances I was
        able to ascend and descend rocks, which otherwise would have been
        completely impassable for a single person. The combined weight of
        these two things amounted to less than half-a-pound.</p><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
        mentioned (<a href="#Pg055" class="tei tei-ref">p. 55</a>) that the
        rocks of the south-west ridge are by no means difficult for some
        distance above the Col du Lion. This is true of the rocks up to the
        level of the Chimney, but they steepen when that is passed, and
        remaining smooth and with but few fractures, and still continuing to
        dip outwards, present some steps of a very uncertain kind,
        particularly when they are glazed with ice. At this point (just above
        the Chimney) the climber is obliged to follow the southern (or Breil)
        side of the ridge, but, in a few feet more, one must turn over to the
        northern (or Z’Mutt) side, where, in most years, nature kindly
        provides a snow-slope. When this is surmounted, one can again return
        to the crest of the ridge, and follow it, by easy rocks, to the foot
        of the Great Tower. This was the highest point attained by Mr.
        Hawkins in 1860, and it was also our highest on the 9th of July.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Great Tower
        is one of the most striking features of the ridge. It stands out like
        a turret at the angle of a castle. Behind <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page74">[pg 74]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>it a battlemented wall leads upwards to the
        citadel.<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href=
        "#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a> Seen
        from the Théodule pass, it looks only an insignificant pinnacle, but
        as one approaches it (on the ridge) so it seems to rise, and, when
        one is at its base, it completely conceals the upper parts of the
        mountain. I found here a suitable place for the tent; which, although
        not so well protected as the second platform, possessed the advantage
        of being 300 feet higher up; and fascinated by the wildness of the
        cliffs, and enticed by the perfection of the weather, I went on to
        see what was behind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first step was
        a difficult one. The ridge became diminished to the least possible
        width—it was hard to keep one’s balance—and just where it was
        narrowest, a more than perpendicular mass barred the way. Nothing
        fairly within arm’s reach could be laid hold of; it was necessary to
        spring up, and then to haul one’s-self over the sharp edge by sheer
        strength. Progression directly upwards was then impossible. Enormous
        and appalling precipices plunged down to the Tiefenmatten glacier on
        the left, but round the right-hand side it was just possible to go.
        One hindrance then succeeded another, and much time was consumed in
        seeking the way. I have a vivid recollection of a gully of more than
        usual perplexity at the side of the Great Tower, with minute ledges
        and steep walls; of the ledges dwindling down and at last ceasing;
        and of finding myself, with arms and legs divergent, fixed as if
        crucified, pressing against the rock, and feeling each rise and fall
        of my chest as I breathed; of screwing my head round to look for
        hold, and not seeing any, and of jumping sideways on to the other
        side. ’Tis vain to attempt to describe such places. Whether they are
        sketched with a light hand, or wrought out in laborious detail, one
        stands an equal chance of being misunderstood. Their enchantment to
        the climber arises from their calls on his faculties, in their
        demands on his strength, and on overcoming the impediments which they
        oppose to his skill. The non-mountaineering reader cannot feel this,
        and his interest in descriptions of such places is usually small,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span><a name="Pg075"
        id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>unless he supposes that the
        situations are perilous. They are not necessarily perilous, but I
        think that it is impossible to avoid giving such an impression if the
        difficulties are particularly insisted upon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About this part
        there was a change in the quality of the rock, and there was a change
        in the general appearance of the ridge. The rocks (talcose gneiss)
        below this spot were singularly firm; it was rarely necessary to test
        one’s hold; the way led over the living rock, and not up rent-off
        fragments. But here, all was decay and ruin. The crest of the ridge
        was shattered and cleft, and the feet sank in the chips which had
        drifted down; while above, huge blocks, hacked and carved by the hand
        of time, nodded to the sky, looking like the grave-stones of giants.
        Out of curiosity I wandered to a notch in the ridge, between two
        tottering piles of immense masses, which seemed to need but a few
        pounds on one or the other side to make them fall; so nicely poised
        that they would literally have rocked in the wind, for they were put
        in motion by a touch; and based on support so frail that I wondered
        they did not collapse before my eyes. In the whole range of my Alpine
        experience I have seen nothing more striking than this desolate,
        ruined, and shattered ridge at the back of the Great Tower. I have
        seen stranger shapes,—rocks which mimic the human form, with
        monstrous leering faces—and isolated pinnacles, sharper and greater
        than any here; but I have never seen exhibited so impressively the
        tremendous effects which may be produced by frost, and by the
        long-continued action of forces whose individual effects are barely
        perceptible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is needless to
        say that it is impossible to climb by the crest of the ridge at this
        part; still one is compelled to keep near to it, for there is no
        other way. Generally speaking, the angles on the Matterhorn are too
        steep to allow the formation of considerable beds of snow, but here
        there is a corner which permits it to accumulate, and it is turned to
        gratefully, for, by its assistance, one can ascend four times as
        rapidly as upon the rocks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Tower was now
        almost out of sight, and I looked over <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the central Pennine Alps to the Grand Combin,
        and to the chain of Mont Blanc. My neighbour, the Dent d’Hérens,
        still rose above me, although but slightly, and the height which had
        been attained could be measured by its help. So far, I had no doubts
        about my capacity to descend that which had been ascended; but, in a
        short time, on looking ahead, I saw that the cliffs steepened, and I
        turned back (without pushing on to them, and getting into
        inextricable difficulties), exulting in the thought that they would
        be passed when we returned together, and that I had, without
        assistance, got nearly to the height of the Dent d’Hérens, and
        considerably higher than any one had been before.<a id="noteref_59"

        exultation was a little premature.</p>

        "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> I left the tent again, and
        thought myself as good as at Breil. The friendly rope and claw had
        done good service, and had smoothened all the difficulties. I lowered
        myself through the Chimney, however, by making a fixture of the rope,
        which I then cut off, and left behind, as there was enough and to
        spare. My axe had proved a great nuisance in coming down, and I left
        it in the tent. It was not attached to the bâton, but was a separate
        affair,—an old navy boarding-axe. While cutting up the different
        snow-beds on the ascent, the bâton trailed behind fastened to the
        rope; and, when climbing, the axe was carried behind, run through the
        rope tied round my waist, and was sufficiently out of the way. But in
        descending, when coming down face outwards (as is always best where
        it is possible), the head or the handle of the weapon caught
        frequently against the rocks, and several times nearly upset me. So,
        out of laziness if you will, it was left in the tent. I paid dearly
        for the imprudence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Col du Lion
        was passed, and fifty yards more would have placed me on the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Staircase,”</span> down which one can
        run. But <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg 77]</span><a name=
        "Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on arriving at an angle
        of the cliffs of the Tête du Lion, while skirting the upper edge of
        the snow which abuts against them, I found that the heat of the two
        past days had nearly obliterated the steps which had been cut when
        coming up. The rocks happened to be impracticable just at this
        corner, so nothing could be done except make the steps afresh. The
        snow was too hard to beat or tread down, and at the angle it was all
        but ice. Half-a-dozen steps only were required, and then the ledges
        could be followed again. So I held to the rock with my right hand,
        and prodded at the snow with the point of my stick until a good step
        was made, and then, leaning round the angle, did the same for the
        other side. So far well, but in attempting to pass the corner (to the
        present moment I cannot tell how it happened) I slipped and
        fell.</p><a name="plate04" id="plate04" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slope was
        steep on which this took place, and was at the top of a gully that
        led down through two subordinate buttresses towards the Glacier du
        Lion—which was just seen, a thousand feet below. The gully narrowed
        and narrowed, until there was a mere thread of snow lying between two
        walls of rock, which came to an abrupt termination at the top of a
        precipice that intervened between it and the glacier. Imagine a
        funnel cut in half through its length, placed at an angle of 45
        degrees, with its point below and its concave side uppermost, and you
        will have a fair idea of the place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The knapsack
        brought my head down first, and I pitched into some rocks about a
        dozen feet below; they caught something and tumbled me off the edge,
        head over heels, into the gully; the bâton was dashed from my hands,
        and I whirled downwards in a series of bounds, each longer than the
        last; now over ice, now into rocks; striking my head four or five
        times, each time with increased force. The last bound sent me
        spinning through the air, in a leap of fifty or sixty feet, from one
        side of the gully to the other, and I struck the rocks, luckily, with
        the whole of my left side. They caught my clothes for a moment, and I
        fell back on to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg
        78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        snow with motion arrested. My head fortunately came the right side
        up, and a few frantic catches brought me to a halt, in the neck of
        the gully, and on the verge of the precipice. Bâton, hat, and veil
        skimmed by and disappeared, and the crash of the rocks—which I had
        started—as they fell on to the glacier, told how narrow had been the
        escape from utter destruction. As it was, I fell nearly 200 feet in
        seven or eight bounds. Ten feet more would have taken me in one
        gigantic leap of 800 feet on to the glacier below.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The situation was
        sufficiently serious. The rocks could not be left go for a moment,
        and the blood was spirting out of more than twenty cuts. The most
        serious ones were in the head, and I vainly tried to close them with
        one hand, whilst holding on with the other. It was useless; the blood
        jerked out in blinding jets at each pulsation. At last, in a moment
        of inspiration, I kicked out a big lump of snow, and stuck it as a
        plaster on my head. The idea was a happy one, and the flow of blood
        diminished. Then, scrambling up, I got, not a moment too soon, to a
        place of safety, and fainted away. The sun was setting when
        consciousness returned, and it was pitch dark before the Great
        Staircase was descended; but, by a combination of luck and care, the
        whole 4800 feet of descent to Breil was accomplished without a slip,
        or once missing the way. I slunk past the cabin of the cowherds, who
        were talking and laughing inside, utterly ashamed of the state to
        which I had been brought by my imbecility, and entered the inn
        stealthily, wishing to escape to my room unnoticed. But Favre met me
        in the passage, demanded <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is it?”</span>
        screamed with fright when he got a light, and aroused the household.
        Two dozen heads then held solemn council over mine, with more talk
        than action. The natives were unanimous in recommending that hot wine
        (syn. vinegar), mixed with salt, should be rubbed into the cuts. I
        protested, but they insisted. It was all the doctoring they received.
        Whether their rapid healing was to be attributed to that simple
        remedy, or to a good state of health, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page79">[pg 79]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class=

        quickly, and in a few days I was able to move again.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was
        sufficiently dull during this time. I was chiefly occupied in
        meditating on the vanity of human wishes, and in watching my clothes
        being washed in the tub which was turned by the stream in the front
        of the house; and I vowed that if an Englishman should at any time
        fall sick in the Val Tournanche, he should not feel so solitary as I
        did at this dreary time.<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The news of the
        accident brought Jean-Antoine Carrel up to Breil, and, along with the
        haughty chasseur, came one of his relatives, a strong and able young
        fellow named Cæsar. With these two men and Meynet I made another
        start on the 23rd of July. We got to the tent without any trouble,
        and on the following day had ascended beyond the Tower, and were
        picking our way cautiously over the loose rocks behind (where my
        traces of the week before were well apparent) in lovely weather, when
        one of those abominable and almost instantaneous changes occurred, to
        which the Matterhorn is so liable on its southern side. Mists were
        created out of invisible vapours, and in a few minutes snow fell
        heavily. We stopped, as this part was of excessive difficulty, and,
        unwilling to retreat, remained on the spot several hours, in hopes
        that another change would occur; but, as it did not, we at length
        went down to the base of the Tower, and commenced to make a third
        platform, at the height of 12,992 feet above the sea. It still
        continued to snow, and we took refuge in the tent. Carrel argued that
        the weather had broken up, and that the mountain would become so
        glazed with ice as to render any attempt futile; and I, that the
        change was only temporary, and that the rocks were too hot to allow
        ice to form upon them. I wished to stay until the weather improved,
        but my leader would not endure contradiction, grew more positive, and
        insisted that we must go down. We went down, and when we got below
        the Col his opinion was found to be wrong; the cloud was confined to
        the upper 3000 feet, and outside it there was brilliant
        weather.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg
        81]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carrel was not an
        easy man to manage. He was perfectly aware that he was the cock of
        the Val Tournanche, and he commanded the other men as by right. He
        was equally conscious that he was indispensable to me, and took no
        pains to conceal his knowledge of the fact. If he had been commanded,
        or if he had been entreated to stop, it would have been all the same.
        But, let me repeat, he was the only first-rate climber I could find
        who believed that the mountain was not inaccessible. With him I had
        hopes, but without him none; so he was allowed to do as he would. His
        will on this occasion was almost incomprehensible. He certainly could
        not be charged with cowardice, for a bolder man could hardly be
        found; nor was he turning away on account of difficulty, for nothing
        to which we had yet come seemed to be difficult to <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></span>; and
        his strong personal desire to make the ascent was evident. There was
        no occasion to come down on account of food, for we had taken, to
        guard against this very casualty, enough to last for a week; and
        there was no danger, and little or no discomfort, in stopping in the
        tent. It seemed to me that he was spinning out the ascent for his own
        purposes, and that although he wished very much to be the first man
        on the top, and did not object to be accompanied by any one else who
        had the same wish, he had no intention of letting one succeed too
        soon,—perhaps to give a greater appearance of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">éclat</span></span>
        when the thing was accomplished. As he feared no rival, he may have
        supposed that the more difficulties he made the more valuable he
        would be estimated; though, to do him justice, he never showed any
        great hunger for money. His demands were fair, not excessive; but he
        always stipulated for so much per day, and so, under any
        circumstances, he did not do badly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Vexed at having my
        time thus frittered away, I was still well pleased when he
        volunteered to start again on the morrow, if it should be fine. We
        were to advance the tent to the foot of the Tower, to fix ropes in
        the most difficult parts beyond, and to make a push for the summit on
        the following day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next morning
        (Friday the 25th) when I arose, good little <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page82">[pg 82]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Meynet was ready and waiting, and he said that
        the two Carrels had gone off some time before, and had left word that
        they intended marmot-hunting, as the day was favourable for that
        sport.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href=
        "#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> My
        holiday had nearly expired, and these men clearly could not be relied
        upon; so, as a last resort, I proposed to the hunchback to accompany
        me alone, to see if we could not get higher than before, though of
        reaching the summit there was little or no hope. He did not hesitate,
        and in a few hours we stood—for the third time together—upon the Col
        du Lion. It was the first time Meynet had seen the view unclouded.
        The poor little deformed peasant gazed upon it silently and
        reverently for a time, and then, unconsciously, fell on one knee in
        an attitude of adoration, and clasped his hands, exclaiming in
        ecstasy, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, beautiful mountains!”</span>
        His actions were as appropriate as his words were natural, and tears
        bore witness to the reality of his emotion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our power was too
        limited to advance the tent, so we slept at the old station, and
        starting very early the next morning, passed the place where we had
        turned back on the 24th, and, subsequently, my highest point on the
        19th. We found the crest of the ridge so treacherous that we took to
        the cliffs on the right, although most unwillingly. Little by little
        we fought our way up, but at length we were both spread-eagled on the
        all but perpendicular face, unable to advance, and barely able to
        descend. We returned to the ridge. It was almost equally difficult,
        and infinitely more unstable; and at length, after having pushed our
        attempts as far as was prudent, I determined to return to Breil, and
        to have a light ladder made to assist us to overcome some of the
        steepest parts.<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href=
        "#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> I
        expected, too, that by this time Carrel would have had enough
        marmot-hunting, and would deign to accompany us
        again.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span><a name=
        "Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We came down at a
        great pace, for we were now so familiar with the mountain, and with
        each other’s wants, that we knew immediately when to give a helping
        hand, and when to let alone. The rocks also were in a better state
        than I have ever seen them, being almost entirely free from glaze of
        ice. Meynet was always merriest on the difficult parts, and, on the
        most difficult, kept on enunciating the sentiment, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We can only die once,”</span> which thought seemed to
        afford him infinite satisfaction. We arrived at the inn early in the
        evening, and I found my projects summarily and unexpectedly knocked
        on the head.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Professor Tyndall
        had arrived while we were absent, and he had engaged both Cæsar and
        Jean-Antoine Carrel. Bennen was also with him, together with a
        powerful and active friend, a Valaisan guide, named Anton Walter.
        They had a ladder already prepared, provisions were being collected,
        and they intended to start on the following morning (Sunday). This
        new arrival took me by surprise. Bennen, it will be remembered,
        refused point-blank to take Professor Tyndall on the Matterhorn in
        1861. <span class="tei tei-q">“He was dead against any attempt on the
        mountain,”</span> says Tyndall. He was now eager to set out.
        Professor Tyndall has not explained in what way this revolution came
        about in his guide. I was equally astonished at the faithlessness of
        Carrel, and attributed it to pique at our having presumed to do
        without him. It was useless to compete with the Professor and his
        four men, who were ready to start in a few hours, so I waited to see
        what would come of their attempt.<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64"
        href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Everything seemed
        to favour it, and they set out on a fine morning in high spirits,
        leaving me tormented with envy and all uncharitableness. If they
        succeeded, they carried off the prize for which I had been so long
        struggling; and if they failed, there was <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page84">[pg 84]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>no time to make another attempt, for I was due
        in a few days more in London. When this came home clearly to me, I
        resolved to leave Breil at once; but, when packing up, found that
        some necessaries had been left behind in the tent. So I went off
        about midday to recover them; caught the army of the Professor before
        it reached the Col, as they were going very slowly; left them there
        (stopping to take food), and went on to the tent. I was near to it
        when all at once I heard a noise aloft, and, on looking up, perceived
        a stone of at least a foot cube flying straight at my head. I ducked,
        and scrambled under the lee side of a friendly rock, while the stone
        went by with a loud buzz. It was the advanced guard of a perfect
        storm of stones, which descended with infernal clatter down the very
        edge of the ridge, leaving a trail of dust behind, with a strong
        smell of sulphur, that told who had sent them. The men below were on
        the look-out, but the stones did not come near them, and breaking
        away on one side went down to the Glacier du Lion.<a id="noteref_65"
        name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I waited at the
        tent to welcome the Professor, and when he arrived went down to
        Breil. Early next morning some one ran to me saying that a flag was
        seen on the summit of the Matterhorn. It was not so, however,
        although I saw that they had passed the place where we had turned
        back on the 26th. I had now no doubt of their final success, for they
        had got beyond the point which Carrel, not less than myself, had
        always considered to be the most questionable place on the whole
        mountain. Up to it there was no choice of route,—I suppose that at no
        one point between it and the Col was it possible to diverge a dozen
        paces to the right or left, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg
        85]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>but
        beyond it it was otherwise, and we had always agreed, in our debates,
        that if it could be passed success was certain. The <a href="#fig32"
        class="tei tei-ref">accompanying outline</a> from a sketch taken from
        the door of the inn at Breil will help to explain. The letter
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">A</span></span> indicates the position of the
        Great Tower; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        "tei tei-q">“cravate”</span> (the strongly-marked streak of snow
        referred to on <a href="#Pg076" class="tei tei-ref">p. 76</a>, and
        which we just failed to arrive at on the 26th); <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">B</span></span> the place
        where we now saw something that looked like a flag. Behind the point
        B a nearly level ridge leads up to the foot of the final peak, which
        will be understood by a reference to the outline <a href="#plate02"
        class="tei tei-ref">facing p. 44</a>, on which the same letters
        indicate the same places. It was just now said, we considered that if
        the point <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">C</span></span> could be passed, success was
        certain. Tyndall was at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">B</span></span> very early in the morning, and I
        did not doubt that he would reach the summit, although it yet
        remained problematical whether he would be able to stand on the very
        highest point. The summit was evidently formed of a long ridge, on
        which there were two points nearly equally elevated—so equally that
        one could not say which was the highest—and between the two there
        seemed to be a deep <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My knapsack was
        packed, and I had taken a parting glass of wine with Favre, who was
        jubilant at the success which was to make the fortune of his inn; but
        I could not bring myself to leave until the result was heard, and
        lingered about, as a foolish lover hovers round the object of his
        affections, even after he has been contemptuously rejected. The sun
        had set before the men were descried coming over the pastures. There
        was no spring in their steps—they, too, were defeated. The Carrels
        hid their heads, and the others said, as men will do when they have
        been beaten, that the mountain was horrible, impossible, and so
        forth. Professor Tyndall told me they had arrived <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">within a stone’s throw
        of the summit</span></span>, and admonished me to have nothing more
        to do with the mountain. I understood him to say that he should not
        try again, and ran down to the village of Val Tournanche, almost
        inclined to believe that the mountain was inaccessible; leaving the
        tent, ropes, and other matters in the hands of Favre, to be placed at
        the disposal of any person who wished to ascend it, more, I am
        afraid, out of irony than from generosity. There may have been those
        who believed that the Matterhorn could be ascended, but, anyhow,
        their faith did not bring forth works. No one tried again in
        1862.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Business took me
        into Dauphiné before returning to London, and a week after Tyndall’s
        defeat I lay one night, after a sultry day, half-asleep, tossing
        about in one of the abominations which serve for beds in the inn kept
        by the Deputy-Mayor of La Ville de Val Louise; looking at a strange
        ruddiness on the ceiling, which I thought might be some effect of
        electricity produced by the irritation of the myriads of fleas; when
        the great bell of the church, close at hand, pealed out with loud and
        hurried clangour. I jumped up, for the voices and movements of the
        people in the house made me think of fire. It <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></span> fire;
        and I saw from my window, on the other side of the river, great
        forked flames shooting high into the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page87">[pg 87]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>sky, black dots with long shadows hurrying
        towards the place, and the crests of the ridges catching the light
        and standing out like spectres. All the world was in motion, for the
        neighbouring villages—now aroused—rang out the alarm. I pulled on my
        shirt, and tore over the bridge. Three large chalets were on fire,
        and were surrounded by a mass of people, who were bringing all their
        pots and pans, and anything that would hold water. They formed
        themselves into several chains, each two deep, leading towards the
        nearest stream, and passed the water up one side, and the empty
        utensils down the other. My old friend the mayor was there, in full
        force, striking the ground with his stick, and vociferating,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Work! work!”</span> but the men, with much
        presence of mind, chiefly ranged themselves on the sides of the empty
        buckets, and left the real work to their better halves. Their efforts
        were useless, and the chalets burnt themselves out.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next morning I
        visited the still smouldering ruins, and saw the homeless families
        sitting in a dismal row in front of their charred property. The
        people said that one of the houses had been well insured, and that
        its owner had endeavoured to forestall luck. He had arranged the
        place for a bonfire, set the lower rooms on fire in several places,
        and had then gone out of the way, leaving his wife and children in
        the upper rooms, to be roasted or not as the case might be. His plans
        only partially succeeded, and it was satisfactory to see the
        scoundrel brought back in the custody of two stalwart gensdarmes.
        Three days afterwards I was in London.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I crossed the
        Channel on the 29th of July 1863, embarrassed by the possession of
        two ladders, each twelve feet long, which joined together like those
        used by firemen, and shut up like parallel rulers. My luggage was
        highly suggestive of housebreaking, for, besides these, there were
        several coils of rope, and numerous tools of suspicious appearance,
        and it was reluctantly admitted into France, but it passed through
        the custom-house with less trouble than I anticipated, after a timely
        expenditure of a few francs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am not in love
        with the douane. It is the purgatory of travellers, where uncongenial
        spirits mingle together for a time, before they are separated into
        rich and poor. The douaniers look upon tourists as their natural
        enemies; see how eagerly they pounce upon the portmanteaux! One of
        them has discovered something! He has never seen its like before, and
        he holds it aloft in the face of its owner, with inquisitorial
        insolence. <span class="tei tei-q">“But <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">what is</span></span>
        this?”</span> The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg
        89]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>explanation is only half-satisfactory.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But what is <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">this</span></span>?”</span> says he, laying hold
        of a little box. <span class="tei tei-q">“Powder.”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But that it is forbidden to carry of powder
        on the railway.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Bah!”</span> says
        another and older hand, <span class="tei tei-q">“pass the effects of
        Monsieur;”</span> and our countryman—whose cheeks had begun to redden
        under the stares of his fellow-travellers—is allowed to depart with
        his half-worn tooth-brush, while the discomfited douanier gives a
        mighty shrug at the strange habits of those <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“whose insular position excludes them from the march of
        continental ideas.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My real troubles
        commenced at Susa. The officials there, more honest and more obtuse
        than the Frenchmen, declined at one and the same time to be bribed,
        or to pass my baggage until a satisfactory account of it was
        rendered; and, as they refused to believe the true explanation, I was
        puzzled what to say, but was presently relieved from the dilemma by
        one of the men, who was cleverer than his fellows, suggesting that I
        was going to Turin to exhibit in the streets; that I mounted the
        ladder and balanced myself on the end of it, then lighted my pipe and
        put the point of the bâton in its bowl, and caused the bâton to
        gyrate around my head. The rope was to keep back the spectators, and
        an Englishman in my company was the agent. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Monsieur is acrobat then?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, certainly.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Pass
        the effects of Monsieur the acrobat!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These ladders were
        the source of endless trouble. Let us pass over the doubts of the
        guardians of the Hôtel d’Europe (Trombetta), whether a person in the
        possession of such questionable articles should be admitted to their
        very respectable house, and get to Chatillon, at the entrance of the
        Val Tournanche. A mule was chartered to carry them, and, as they were
        too long to sling across its back, they were arranged lengthways, and
        one end projected over the animal’s head, while the other extended
        beyond its tail. A mule when going up or down hill always moves with
        a jerky action, and in consequence of this the ladders hit my mule
        severe blows between its ears and in its flanks. The beast, not
        knowing what strange creature it had on its back, naturally tossed
        its head and threw out <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg
        90]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>its
        legs, and this, of course, only made the blows that it received more
        severe. At last it ran away, and would have perished by rolling down
        a precipice, if the men had not caught hold of its tail. The end of
        the matter was that a man had to follow the mule, holding the end of
        the ladders, which obliged him to move his arms up and down
        incessantly, and to bow to the hind quarters of the animal in a way
        that afforded more amusement to his comrades than it did to him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was once more
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">en
        route</span></span> for the Matterhorn, for I had heard in the spring
        of 1863 the cause of the failure of Professor Tyndall, and learnt
        that the case was not so hopeless as it appeared to be at one time. I
        found that he arrived as far only as the northern end of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the shoulder.”</span> The point at which he says,<a id=
        "noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> they
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sat down with broken hopes, the summit
        within a stone’s throw of us, but still defying us,”</span> was not
        the notch or cleft at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">D</span></span> (which is literally within a stone’s
        throw of the summit), but another and more formidable cleft that
        intervenes between the northern end of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        shoulder”</span> and the commencement of the final peak. It is marked
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">E</span></span>
        on the outline which <a href="#plate02" class="tei tei-ref">faces p.
        44</a>. Carrel and all the men who had been with me knew of the
        existence of this cleft, and of the pinnacle which rose between it
        and the final peak;<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href=
        "#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a> and we
        had frequently talked about the best manner of passing the place. On
        this we disagreed, but we were both of opinion that when we got to
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the shoulder,”</span> it would be necessary
        to bear down gradually to the right or to the left, to avoid coming
        to the top of the notch. Tyndall’s party, after arriving at
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the shoulder,”</span> was led by his guides
        along the crest of the ridge, and, consequently, when they got to its
        northern end, they came to the top of the notch, instead of the
        bottom—to the dismay of all but the Carrels. Dr. Tyndall’s words are,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The ridge was here split by a deep cleft
        which separated it from the final precipice, and the case became more
        hopeless as we came more near.”</span> The Professor adds,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The mountain is 14,800 <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg 91]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>feet high, and 14,600 feet had been
        accomplished.”</span> He greatly deceived himself; by the barometric
        measurements of Signor Giordano the notch is no less than 800 feet
        below the summit. The guide Walter (Dr. Tyndall says) said it was
        impossible to proceed, and the Carrels, appealed to for their opinion
        (this is their own account), gave as an answer, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We are porters; ask your guides.”</span> Bennen, thus
        left to himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“was finally forced to
        accept defeat.”</span> Tyndall had nevertheless accomplished an
        advance of about 400 feet over one of the most difficult parts of the
        mountain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are material
        discrepancies between the published narratives of Professor
        Tyndall<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href=

        verbal accounts of the Carrels. The former says the men had to be
        <span class="tei tei-q">“urged on,”</span> that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“they pronounced flatly against the final
        precipice,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“they yielded so

        made to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘What
        could I do, sir? not one of them would accompany me.’</span> It was
        the accurate truth.”</span> Jean-Antoine Carrel says that when
        Professor Tyndall gave the order to turn <span class=

        have advanced to examine the route, as he did not think that farther

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Val Tournanche
        is one of the most charming valleys in the Italian Alps; it is a
        paradise to an artist, and if the space at my command were greater, I
        would willingly linger over its groves of chestnuts, its bright
        trickling rills and its roaring torrents, its upland unsuspected
        valleys and its noble cliffs. The path rises steeply from Chatillon,
        but it is well shaded, and the heat of the summer sun is tempered by
        cool air and spray which comes off the ice-cold streams.<a id=

        from the path, at several places on the right bank of the valley,
        groups of arches which have been built high up against the faces of
        the cliffs. Guide-books repeat—on whose authority I know not—that
        they are the remains of a Roman aqueduct. They have the Roman
        boldness of conception, but the work has not the usual Roman
        solidity. The arches have always seemed to me to be the remains of an
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">unfinished</span></span> work, and I learn from
        Jean-Antoine Carrel that there are other groups of arches, which are
        not seen from the path, all having the same appearance. It may be
        questioned whether those seen near the village of Antey are Roman.
        Some of them are semicircular, whilst others are distinctly pointed.
        <a href="#fig34" class="tei tei-ref">Here</a> is one of the latter,
        which might pass for fourteenth-century work, or later;—a two-centred
        arch, with mean voussoirs, and the masonry in rough courses. These
        arches are well worth the attention of an archæologist, but some
        difficulty will be found in approaching them closely.</p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We sauntered up
        the valley, and got to Breil when all were asleep. A halo round the
        moon promised watery weather, and we were not disappointed, for, on
        the next day (August 1), rain fell heavily, and when the clouds
        lifted for a time, we saw that new snow lay thickly over everything
        higher than 9000 feet. J.-A. Carrel was ready and waiting (as I had
        determined to give the bold cragsman another chance); and he did not
        need to say that the Matterhorn would be impracticable for several
        days after all this new snow, even if the weather were to arrange
        itself at once. Our first day together was accordingly spent upon a
        neighbouring summit, the Cimes Blanches; a degraded mountain, well
        known for its fine panoramic view. It was little that we saw; for, in
        every direction except to the south, writhing masses of heavy clouds
        obscured everything; and to the south our view was intercepted by a
        peak higher than the Cimes Blanches, named the Grand Tournalin.<a id=

        got some innocent pleasure out of watching the gambolings of a number
        of goats, who became fast friends after we had given them some salt;
        in fact, too fast, and caused us no little annoyance when we were
        descending. <span class="tei tei-q">“Carrel,”</span> I said, as a
        number of stones whizzed by which they had dislodged, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“this must be put a stop to.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Diable!”</span> he grunted, <span class="tei tei-q">“it
        is very well to talk, but how will you do it?”</span> I said that I
        would try; and, sitting down, poured a little brandy into the hollow
        of my hand, and allured the nearest goat with deceitful gestures. It
        was one who had gobbled up the paper in which the salt had been
        carried—an animal of enterprising character—and it advanced
        fearlessly and licked up the brandy. I shall not easily forget its
        surprise. It stopped short, and coughed, and looked at me as much as
        to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, you cheat!”</span> and spat and
        ran away; stopping now and then to cough and spit again. We were not
        troubled any more by those goats.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">More snow fell
        during the night, and our attempt on the Matterhorn was postponed
        indefinitely. As there was nothing to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a>be done at Breil, I determined to make the tour
        of the mountain, and commenced by inventing a pass from Breil to
        Zermatt,<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href=
        "#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> in place
        of the hackneyed Théodule. Any one who looks at the map will see that
        the latter pass makes a considerable détour to the east, and,
        apparently, goes out of the way. I thought that it was possible to
        strike out a shorter route, both in distance and in time, and we set
        out on the 3rd of August, to carry out the idea. We followed the
        Théodule path for some time, but quitted it when it bore away to the
        east, and kept straight on until we struck the moraine of the Mont
        Cervin glacier. Our track still continued in a straight line up the
        centre of the glacier to the foot of a tooth of rock, which juts
        prominently out of the ridge (Furggengrat) connecting the Matterhorn
        with the Théodulehorn. The head of the glacier was connected with
        this little peak by a steep bank of snow; but we were able to go
        straight up, and struck the Col at its lowest point, a little to the
        right (that is to say, to the east) of the above-mentioned peak. On
        the north there was a snow-slope corresponding to that on the other
        side. Half-an-hour took us to its base. We then bore away over the
        nearly level plateau of the Furggengletscher, making a straight track
        to the Hörnli, from whence we descended to Zermatt by one of the
        well-known paths. This pass has been dubbed the Breuiljoch by the
        Swiss surveyors. It is a few feet higher than the Théodule, and it
        may be recommended to those who are familiar with that pass, as it
        gives equally fine views, and is accessible at all times. But it will
        never be frequented like the Théodule, as the snow-slope at its
        summit, at certain times, will require the use of the axe. It took us
        six hours and a quarter to go from one place to the other, which was
        an hour longer than we would have occupied by the Théodule, although
        the distance in miles is less.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is stated in
        one of the MS. note-books of the late Principal J. D. Forbes, that

        between the Val Tournanche and Zermatt, and that it was abandoned for
        the Théodule in consequence of changes <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        authority for the statement was not given. I presume it was from
        local tradition, but I readily credit it; for, before the time that
        the glaciers had shrunk to so great an extent, the steep snow-slopes
        above mentioned, in all probability, did not exist; and, most likely,
        the glaciers led by very gentle gradients up to the summit; in which
        case the route would have formed the natural highway between the two
        places. It is far from impossible, if the glaciers continue to
        diminish at their present rapid rate,<a id="noteref_75" name=

        Théodule itself, the easiest and the most frequented of all the

        easily approached; for the turf at the top was slippery, and the
        rocks had everywhere been rounded by the glacier,—which formerly
        extended far away. This gorge seems to have been made chiefly by the
        torrent, and to have been excavated subsequently to the retreat of
        the glacier. It seems so because not merely upon its walls are there
        the marks of running water, but even upon the rounded rocks at the
        top of its walls, at a height of seventy or eighty feet above the
        present level of the torrent, there are some of those queer

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A little bridge,
        apparently frail, spans the torrent just above the entrance to this
        gorge, and from it one perceives, being fashioned in the rocks below,
        concavities similar to those to which reference has just been made.
        The torrent is seen hurrying forwards. Not everywhere. In some places
        the water strikes projecting angles, and, thrown back by them,
        remains almost stationary, eddying round and round: in others,
        obstructions fling it up in fountains, which play perpetually on the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">under</span></span> surfaces of overhanging
        masses; and sometimes do so in such a way that the water not only
        works upon the under surfaces, but round the corner; that is to say,
        upon the surfaces which are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></span> opposed to the general
        direction of the current. In all cases <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">concavities</span></span> are being produced.
        Projecting angles are rounded, it is true, and are more or less
        convex, but they are overlooked on account of the prevalence of
        concave forms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cause and effect
        help each other here. The inequalities of the torrent bed and walls
        cause its eddyings, and the eddies fashion the concavities. The more
        profound the latter become, the more disturbance is caused in the
        water. The destruction of the rocks proceeds at an ever-increasing
        rate; for the larger the amount of surface that is exposed, the
        greater are the opportunities for the assaults of heat and cold.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When water is in
        the form of glacier it has not the power of making concavities, such
        as these, in rocks, and of working upon surfaces which are not
        opposed to the direction of the current. Its nature is changed; it
        operates in a different way, and it leaves marks which are readily
        distinguished from those produced by torrent-action.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prevailing
        forms which result from glacier-action are more or less <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">convex</span></span>.
        Ultimately, all angles and almost all curves are obliterated, and
        large areas of flat surfaces are produced. This perfection of
        abrasion is rarely found, except in such localities as have sustained
        a grinding much more severe than that which has occurred in the Alps;
        and, generally speaking, the dictum of the veteran <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page99">[pg 99]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>geologist Studer, quoted below, is

        merely can the operations of extinct glaciers be traced in detail by
        means of the bosses of rock popularly termed <span class=

        moutonnées</span></span>, but their effects in the aggregate, on a
        range of mountains or an entire country, can be recognised sometimes
        at a distance of fifteen or twenty miles from the incessant
        repetition of these convex forms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We finished up the
        3d of August with a walk over the Findelen glacier, and returned to
        Zermatt at a later hour than we intended, both very sleepy. This is
        noteworthy only on account of that which followed. We had to cross
        the Col de Valpelline on the next day, and an early start was
        desirable. Monsieur Seiler, excellent man, knowing this, called us
        himself, and when he came to my door, I answered, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“All right, Seiler, I will get up,”</span> and
        immediately turned over to the other side, saying to myself,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“First of all, ten minutes more
        sleep.”</span> But Seiler waited and listened, and, suspecting the
        case, knocked again. <span class="tei tei-q">“Herr Whymper, have you
        got a light?”</span> Without thinking what the consequences might be,
        I answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> and then the worthy
        man actually forced the lock off his own door to give me one. By
        similar and equally friendly and disinterested acts, Monsieur Seiler
        has acquired his enviable reputation.</p>

        thickets of grey alder that skirt the path up the right bank of the
        exquisite little valley which leads to the Z’Muttgletscher.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing can well
        seem more inaccessible than the Matterhorn upon this side; and even
        in cold blood one holds the breath when looking at its stupendous
        cliffs. There are but few equal to them in size in the Alps, and
        there are none which can more truly be termed <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">precipices</span></span>. Greatest of them all
        is the immense north cliff,—that which bends over towards the
        Z’Muttgletscher. Stones which drop <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>from the top of that amazing wall fall for about
        1500 feet before they touch anything; and those which roll down from
        above, and bound over it, fall to a much greater depth, and leap
        well-nigh 1000 feet beyond its base. This side of the mountain has
        always seemed sombre—sad—terrible; it is painfully suggestive of
        decay, ruin, and death; and it is now, alas! more than terrible by
        its associations.</p>

        is proceeding ceaselessly—incessantly. You will <span class=

        but, probably, you will not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        masses thunder as loudly as heavy guns, and the echoes roll back from
        the Ebihorn opposite, they will still be as pin-points against this
        grand old face, so vast is its scale!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If you would see
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“aspects of destruction,”</span> you must
        come still closer, and climb its cliffs and ridges, or mount to the
        plateau of the Matterhorngletscher, which is cut up and ploughed up
        by these missiles, and strewn on its surface with their smaller
        fragments; the larger masses, falling with tremendous velocity,
        plunge into the snow and are lost to sight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
        Matterhorngletscher, too, sends down <span class=

        avalanches, as if in rivalry with the rocks behind. Round the whole
        of its northern side it does not terminate in the usual manner by
        gentle slopes, but comes to a sudden end at the top of the steep
        rocks which lie betwixt it and the Z’Muttgletscher; and seldom does
        an hour pass without a huge slice breaking away and falling with
        dreadful uproar on to the slopes below, where it is re-compacted.</p>

        outside pines of the Z’Mutt forests, stripped of their bark, and
        blanched by the weather, are a fit foreground to a scene that can
        hardly be surpassed in solemn grandeur. It is a subject worthy of the
        pencil of a great painter, and one which would tax the powers of the

        Z’Muttgletscher proper, and which separates its higher feeder, the
        Stockgletscher, from its lower and greater one, the Tiefenmatten),
        Carrel himself, one of the least demonstrative of men, could not
        refrain from expressing wonder at the steepness of its faces, and at

        up the southern cliffs of the Stockje. We clambered up, and found
        that it had been killed by a most uncommon and extraordinary
        accident. It had slipped on the upper rocks, had rolled over and over
        down a slope of débris, without being able to regain its feet, had
        fallen over a little patch of rocks that projected through the
        débris, and had caught the points of both horns on a tiny ledge, not
        an inch broad. It had just been able to touch the débris, where it
        led away down from the rocks, and had pawed and scratched until it
        could no longer touch. It had evidently been starved to death, and we
        found the poor beast almost swinging in the air, with its head thrown
        back and tongue protruding, looking to the sky as if imploring
        help.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hill-tops were
        clouded when we rose from our hay on the 5th of August. We decided
        not to continue the tour of our <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>mountain immediately, and returned over our
        track of the preceding day to the highest châlet on the left bank of
        the valley, with the intention of attacking the Dent d’Erin on the
        next morning. We were interested in this summit, more on account of
        the excellent view which it commanded of the south-west ridge and the
        terminal peak of the Matterhorn, than from any other reason.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dent d’Erin
        had not been ascended at this time, and we had diverged from our
        route on the 4th, and had scrambled some distance up the base of Mont
        Brulé, to see how far its south-western slopes were assailable. We
        were divided in opinion as to the best way of approaching the peak.
        Carrel, true to his habit of sticking to rocks in preference to ice,
        counselled ascending by the long buttress of the Tête de Bella Cia
        (which descends towards the west, and forms the southern boundary of
        the last glacier that falls into the Glacier de Zardesan), and thence
        traversing the heads of all the tributaries of the Zardesan to the
        western and rocky ridge of the Dent. I, on the other hand, proposed
        to follow the Glacier de Zardesan itself throughout its entire
        length, and from the plateau at its head (where my proposed route
        would cross Carrel’s) to make directly towards the summit, up the
        snow-covered glacier slope, instead of by the western ridge. The
        hunchback, who was accompanying us on these excursions, declared in
        favour of Carrel’s route, and it was accordingly adopted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first part of
        the programme was successfully executed; and at 10.30 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> on the
        6th of August, we were sitting astride the western ridge, at a height
        of about 12,500 feet, looking down upon the Tiefenmatten glacier. To
        all appearance another hour would place us on the summit; but in
        another hour we found that we were not destined to succeed. The ridge
        (like all of the principal rocky ridges of the great peaks upon which
        I have stood) had been completely shattered by frost, and was nothing
        more than a heap of piled up fragments. It was always narrow,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104"
        id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and where it was narrowest it
        was also the most unstable and the most difficult. On neither side
        could we ascend it by keeping a little below its crest,—on the side
        of the Tiefenmatten because it was too steep, and on both sides
        because the dislodgment of a single block would have disturbed the
        equilibrium of all those which were above. Forced, therefore, to keep
        to the very crest of the ridge, and unable to deviate a single step
        either to the right or to the left, we were compelled to trust
        ourselves upon unsteady masses, which trembled under our tread, which
        sometimes settled down, grating in a hollow and ominous manner, and
        which seemed as if a little shake would send the whole roaring down
        in one awful avalanche.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I followed my
        leader, who said not a word, and did not rebel until we came to a
        place where a block had to be surmounted which lay poised across the
        ridge. Carrel could not climb it without assistance, or advance
        beyond it until I joined him above; and as he stepped off my back on
        to it, I felt it quiver and bear down upon me. I doubted the
        possibility of another man standing upon it without bringing it down.
        Then I rebelled. There was no honour to be gained by persevering, or
        dishonour in turning from a place which was dangerous on account of
        its excessive difficulty. So we returned to Prerayen, for there was
        too little time to allow us to re-ascend by the other route, which
        was subsequently shown to be the right way up the mountain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Four days
        afterwards a party of Englishmen (including my friends, W. E. Hall,
        Craufurd Grove, and Reginald Macdonald), arrived in the Valpelline,
        and (unaware of our attempt) on the 12th, under the skilful guidance
        of Melchior Anderegg, made the first ascent of the Dent d’Erin by the
        route which I had proposed. This is the only mountain which I have
        essayed to ascend, that has not, sooner or later, fallen to me. Our
        failure was mortifying, yet I am satisfied that we did wisely in
        returning, and that if we had persevered, by Carrel’s route, another
        Alpine accident would have been recorded. Other routes have been
        since discovered up <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg
        105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        Dent d’Erin. The ascent ranks amongst the more difficult ones which
        have been made in the Alps.<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href=
        "#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 7th of
        August we crossed the Va Cornère pass,<a id="noteref_80" name=
        "noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> and had
        a good look at the mountain named the Grand Tournalin as we descended
        the Val de Chignana. This mountain was seen from so many points, and
        was so much higher than any peak in its immediate neighbourhood, that
        it was bound to give a very fine view; and (as the weather continued
        unfavourable for the Matterhorn) I arranged with Carrel to ascend it
        the next day, and despatched him direct to the village of Val
        Tournanche to make the necessary preparations, whilst I, with Meynet,
        made a short cut to Breil, at the back of Mont Panquero, by a little
        pass locally known as the Col de Fenêtre. I rejoined Carrel the same
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106"
        id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>evening at Val Tournanche, and
        we started from that place at a little before 5 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> on the
        8th, to attack the Tournalin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meynet was left
        behind for that day, and most unwillingly did the hunchback part from
        us, and begged hard to be allowed to come. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pay me nothing, only let me go with you;”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall want but a little bread and cheese,
        and of that I won’t eat much;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        would much rather go with you than carry things down the
        valley.”</span> Such were his arguments, and I was really sorry that
        the rapidity of our movements obliged us to desert the good little
        man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carrel led over
        the meadows on the south and east of the bluff upon which the village
        of Val Tournanche is built, and then by a zig-zag path through a long
        and steep forest, making many short cuts, which showed he had a
        thorough knowledge of the ground. After we came again into daylight,
        our route took us up one of those little, concealed, lateral valleys
        which are so numerous on the slopes bounding the Val Tournanche.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This valley, the
        Combe de Ceneil, has a general easterly trend, and contains but one
        small cluster of houses (Ceneil). The Tournalin is situated at the
        head of the Combe, and nearly due east of the village of Val
        Tournanche, but from that place no part of the mountain is visible.
        After Ceneil is passed it comes into view, rising above a cirque of
        cliffs (streaked by several fine waterfalls), at the end of the
        Combe. To avoid these cliffs the path bends somewhat to the south,
        keeping throughout to the left bank of the valley, and at about 3500
        feet above Val Tournanche, and 1500 feet above Ceneil and a mile or
        so to its east, arrives at the base of some moraines, which are
        remarkably large considering the dimensions of the glaciers which
        formed them. The ranges upon the western side of the Val Tournanche
        are seen to great advantage from this spot; and here the path ends
        and the way steepens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we arrived at
        these moraines, we had a choice of two routes. One, continuing to the
        east, over the moraines themselves, the débris above them, and a
        large snow-bed still higher up, to a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>kind of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">col</span></span> or depression to the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">south</span></span> of the peak, from whence an
        easy ridge led towards the summit. The other, over a shrunken glacier
        on our north-east (now, perhaps, not in existence), which led to a
        well-marked <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">col</span></span> on the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">north</span></span> of
        the peak, from whence a less easy ridge rose directly to the highest
        point. We followed the first named of these routes, and in little
        more than half-an-hour stood upon the Col, which commanded a most
        glorious view of the southern side of Monte Rosa, and of the ranges
        to its east, and to the east of the Val d’Ayas.</p><a name="plate07"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst we were
        resting at this point, a large party of vagrant chamois arrived on
        the summit of the mountain from the northern side, some of whom—by
        their statuesque position—seemed to appreciate the grand panorama by
        which they were surrounded, while others amused themselves, like
        two-legged tourists, in rolling stones over the cliffs. The clatter
        of these falling fragments made us look up. The chamois were so
        numerous that we could not count them, and clustered around the
        summit, totally unaware of our presence. They scattered in a panic,
        as if a shell had burst amongst them, when saluted by the cries of my
        excited comrade; and plunged wildly down in several directions, with
        unfaltering and unerring bounds, with such speed and with such grace
        that we were filled with admiration and respect for their
        mountaineering abilities.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ridge that led
        from the Col towards the summit was singularly easy, although well
        broken up by frost, and Carrel thought that it would not be difficult
        to arrange a path for mules out of the shattered blocks; but when we
        arrived on the summit we found ourselves separated from the very
        highest point by a cleft which had been concealed up to that time:
        its southern side was nearly perpendicular, but it was only fourteen
        or fifteen feet deep. Carrel lowered me down, and afterwards
        descended on to the head of my axe, and subsequently on to my
        shoulders, with a cleverness which was almost as far removed from my
        awkwardness as his own efforts were from those of the chamois. A few
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108"
        id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>easy steps then placed us on
        the highest point. It had not been ascended before, and we
        commemorated the event by building a huge cairn, which was seen for
        many a mile, and would have lasted for many a year, had it not been
        thrown down by the orders of Canon Carrel, on account of its
        interrupting the sweep of a camera which he took to the lower summit
        in 1868, in order to photograph the panorama. According to that
        well-known mountaineer the summit of the Grand Tournalin is 6100 feet
        above the village of Val Tournanche, and 11,155 feet above the sea.
        Its ascent (including halts) occupied us only four hours.</p><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I recommend any
        person who has a day to spare in the Val Tournanche to ascend the
        Tournalin. It should be remembered, however (if its ascent is made
        for the sake of the view), that these southern Pennine Alps seldom
        remain unclouded after mid-day, and, indeed, frequently not later
        than 10 or 11 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> Towards sunset the equilibrium of
        the atmosphere is restored, and the clouds very commonly
        disappear.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I advise the
        ascent of this mountain not on account of its height, or from its
        accessibility or inaccessibility, but simply for the wide and
        splendid view which may be seen from its summit. Its position is
        superb, and the list of the peaks which can be seen from it includes
        almost the whole of the principal mountains of the Cottian, Dauphiné,
        Graian, Pennine, and Oberland groups. The view has, in the highest
        perfection, those elements of picturesqueness which are wanting in
        the purely panoramic views of higher <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>summits. There are three principal sections,
        each with a central or dominating point, to which the eye is
        naturally drawn. All three alike are pictures in themselves; yet all
        are dissimilar. In the south, softened by the vapours of the Val
        d’Aoste, extends the long line of the Graians, with mountain after
        mountain 12,000 feet and upwards in height. It is not upon these,
        noble as some of them are, that the eye will rest, but upon the Viso,
        far off in the background. In the west and towards the north the
        range of Mont Blanc, and some of the greatest of the Central Pennine
        Alps (including the Grand Combin and the Dent Blanche) form the
        background, but they are overpowered by the grandeur of the ridges
        which culminate in the Matterhorn. Nor in the east and north, where
        pleasant grassy slopes lead downwards to the Val d’Ayas, nor upon the
        glaciers and snow-fields above them, nor upon the Oberland in the
        background, will the eye long linger, when immediately in front,
        several miles away, but seeming close at hand, thrown out by the pure
        azure sky, there are the glittering crests of Monte Rosa.</p><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those who would,
        but cannot, stand upon the highest Alps, may console themselves with
        the knowledge that they do not usually yield the views that make the
        strongest and most permanent impressions. Marvellous some of the
        panoramas seen from the greatest peaks undoubtedly are; but they are
        necessarily without those isolated and central points which are so
        valuable pictorially. The eye roams over a multitude of objects
        (each, perhaps, grand individually), and, distracted by an
        embarrassment of riches, wanders from one to another, erasing by the
        contemplation of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg
        110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>next
        the effect that was produced by the last; and when those happy
        moments are over, which always fly with too great rapidity, the
        summit is left with an impression that is seldom durable, because it
        is usually vague.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No views create
        such lasting impressions as those which are seen but for a moment,
        when a veil of mist is rent in twain, and a single spire or dome is
        disclosed. The peaks which are seen at these moments are not,
        perhaps, the greatest or the noblest, but the recollection of them
        outlives the memory of any panoramic view, because the picture,
        photographed by the eye, has time to dry, instead of being blurred,
        while yet wet, by contact with other impressions. The reverse is the
        case with the bird’s-eye panoramic views from the great peaks, which
        sometimes embrace a hundred miles in nearly every direction. The eye
        is confounded by the crowd of details, and is unable to distinguish
        the relative importance of the objects which are seen. It is almost
        as difficult to form a just estimate (with the eye) of the respective
        heights of a number of peaks from a very high summit, as it is from
        the bottom of a valley. I think that the grandest and the most
        satisfactory standpoints for viewing mountain scenery are those which
        are sufficiently elevated to give a feeling of depth, as well as of
        height, which are lofty enough to exhibit wide and varied views, but
        not so high as to sink everything to the level of the spectator. The
        view from the Grand Tournalin is a favourable example of this class
        of panoramic views.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We descended from
        the summit by the northern route, and found it tolerably stiff
        clambering as far as the Col. Thence, down the glacier, the way was
        straightforward, and we joined the route taken on the ascent at the
        foot of the ridge leading towards the east. In the evening we
        returned to Breil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is an abrupt
        rise in the valley about two miles to the north of the village of Val
        Tournanche, and just above this step the torrent has eaten its way
        into its bed and formed an extraordinary chasm, which has long been
        known by the name Gouffre <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg

        Busserailles. We lingered about this spot to listen to the thunder of
        the concealed water, and to watch its tumultuous boiling as it issued
        from the gloomy cleft, but our efforts to peer into the mysteries of
        the place were baffled. In November 1865, the intrepid Carrel induced
        two trusty comrades—the Maquignaz’s of Val Tournanche—to lower him by
        a rope into the chasm and over the cataract. The feat required iron
        nerves, and muscles and sinews of no ordinary kind; and its
        performance alone stamps Carrel as a man of dauntless courage. One of
        the Maquignaz’s subsequently descended in the same way, and these two
        men were so astonished at what they saw, that they forthwith set to
        work with hammer and chisel to make a way into this romantic gulf. In
        a few days they constructed a rough but convenient plank gallery into
        the centre of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gouffre</span></span>, along its walls; and, on
        payment of a toll of half a franc, any one can now enter the Gouffre
        des Busserailles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot, without
        a couple of sections and a plan, give an exact idea to the reader of
        this remarkable place. It corresponds in some of its features to the
        gorge <a href="#fig35" class="tei tei-ref">figured upon page 96</a>,
        but it exhibits in a much more notable manner the characteristic
        action and extraordinary power of running water. The length of the
        chasm or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gouffre</span></span> is about 320 feet, and
        from the top of its walls to the surface of the water is about 110
        feet. At no part can the entire length or depth be seen at a glance;
        for, although the width at some places is 15 feet or more, the view
        is limited by the sinuosities of the walls. These are everywhere
        polished to a smooth, vitreous-in-appearance surface. In some places
        the torrent has wormed into the rock, and has left natural bridges.
        The most extraordinary features of the Gouffre des Busserailles,
        however, are the caverns (or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">marmites</span></span> as they are termed),
        which the water has hollowed out of the heart of the rock. Carrel’s
        plank path leads into one of the greatest,—a grotto that is about 28
        feet across at its largest diameter, and 15 or 16 feet high; roofed
        above by the living rock, and with the torrent roaring 50 feet or
        there<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name=
        "Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>abouts below, at the
        bottom of a fissure. This cavern is lighted by candles, and talking
        in it can only be managed by signs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I visited the
        interior of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gouffre</span></span> in 1869, and my wonder at
        its caverns was increased by observing the hardness of the hornblende
        out of which they have been hollowed. Carrel chiselled off a large
        piece, which is now lying before me. It has a highly polished, glassy
        surface, and might be mistaken, for a moment, for ice-polished rock.
        But the water has found out the atoms which were least hard, and it
        is dotted all over by minute depressions, much as the face of one is
        who has suffered from smallpox. The edges of these little hollows are
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">rounded</span></span>, and the whole surfaces of
        the depressions are polished nearly, or quite, as highly as the
        general surface of the fragment. The water has eaten more deeply into
        some veins of steatite than in other places, and the presence of the
        steatite may possibly have had something to do with the formation of
        the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gouffre</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I arrived at Breil
        again after an absence of six days, well satisfied with my tour of
        the Matterhorn, which had been rendered very pleasant by the
        willingness of my guides, and by the kindliness of the natives.
        Still, it must be admitted that the inhabitants of the Val Tournanche
        are behind the times. Their paths are as bad as, or worse than, they
        were in the time of De Saussure, and their inns are much inferior to
        those on the Swiss side. If it were otherwise there would be nothing
        to prevent the valley becoming one of the most popular and frequented
        of all the valleys in the Alps. As it is, tourists who enter it seem
        to think only about how soon they can get out of it, and hence it is
        much less known than it deserves to be on account of its natural
        attractions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I believe that the
        great hindrance to the improvement of the paths in the Italian
        valleys generally is the wide-spread impression that the innkeepers
        would alone directly benefit by any amelioration of their condition.
        To a certain extent this view is correct; but inasmuch as the
        prosperity of the natives is connected with that of the innkeepers,
        the interests of both are pretty nearly identical. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Until their paths are rendered less rough
        and swampy, I think the Italians must submit to see the golden
        harvest principally reaped in Switzerland and Savoy. At the same
        time, let the innkeepers look to the commissariat. Their supplies are
        not unfrequently deficient in quantity, and, according to my
        experience, very often deplorable in quality.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I will not venture
        to criticise in detail the dishes which are brought to table, since I
        am profoundly ignorant of their constitution. It is commonly said
        amongst Alpine tourists that goat flesh represents mutton, and mule
        does service for beef and chamois. I reserve my own opinion upon this
        point until it has been shown what becomes of all the dead mules. But
        I may say, I hope, without wounding the susceptibilities of my
        acquaintances among the Italian innkeepers, that it would tend to
        smoothen their intercourse with their guests if requests for solid
        food were less frequently regarded as criminal. The deprecating airs
        with which inquiries for really substantial food are received always
        remind me of a Dauphiné innkeeper, who remarked that he had heard a
        good many tourists travel in Switzerland. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> I answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“there
        are a good many.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“How many?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> I said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have seen a hundred or more sit down at a table
        d’hôte.”</span> He lifted up his hands—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“they
        would want meat every day!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, that
        is not improbable.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“In that
        case,”</span> he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carrel had
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">carte
        blanche</span></span> in the matter of guides, and his choice fell
        upon his relative Cæsar, Luc Meynet, and two others whose names I do
        not know. These men were now brought together, and our preparations
        were completed, as the weather was clearing up.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We rested on
        Sunday, August 9, eagerly watching the lessening of the mists around
        the great peak, and started just before dawn upon the 10th, on a
        still and cloudless morning, which seemed to promise a happy
        termination to our enterprise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By going always,
        though gently, we arrived upon the Col du Lion before nine o’clock.
        Changes were apparent. Familiar ledges had vanished; the platform,
        whereupon my tent had stood, looked very forlorn, its stones had been
        scattered by wind and frost, and had half disappeared: and the summit
        of the Col itself, which in 1862 had always been respectably broad,
        and covered by snow, was now sharper than the ridge of any church
        roof, and was hard ice. Already we had found that the bad weather of
        the past week had done its work. The rocks for several hundred feet
        below the Col were varnished with ice. Loose, incoherent snow covered
        the older and harder beds below, and we nearly lost our leader
        through its treacherousness. He stepped on some snow which seemed
        firm, and raised his axe to deliver a swinging blow, but, just as it
        was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name=
        "Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>highest, the crust of
        the slope upon which he stood broke away, and poured down in
        serpentine streams, leaving long, bare strips, which glittered in the
        sun, for they were glassy ice. Carrel, with admirable readiness,
        flung himself back on to the rock off which he had stepped, and was
        at once secured. He simply remarked, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
        time we were tied up,”</span> and, after we had been tied up, he went
        to work again as if nothing had happened.<a id="noteref_82" name=
        "noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We had abundant
        illustrations during the next two hours of the value of a rope to
        climbers. We were tied up rather widely apart, and advanced,
        generally, in pairs. Carrel, who led, was followed closely by another
        man, who lent him a shoulder or placed an axe-head under his feet,
        when there was need; and when this couple were well placed the second
        pair advanced, in similar fashion,—the rope being drawn in by those
        above, and paid out gradually by those below. The leading men again
        advanced, or the third pair, and so on. This manner of progression
        was slow, but sure. One man only moved at a time, and if he slipped
        (and we frequently did slip) he could slide scarcely a foot without
        being checked by the others. The certainty and safety of the method
        gave confidence to the one who was moving, and not only nerved him to
        put out his powers to the utmost, but sustained nerve in really
        difficult situations. For these rocks (which, it has been already
        said, were easy enough under ordinary circumstances) were now
        difficult in a high degree. The snow-water which had trickled down
        for many days past in little streams, had taken, naturally, the very
        route by which we wished to ascend; and, refrozen in the night, had
        glazed the slabs over which we had to pass,—sometimes with a fine
        film of ice as thin as a sheet of paper, and sometimes so thickly
        that we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name=
        "Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>could almost cut
        footsteps in it. The weather was superb, the men made light of the
        toil, and shouted to rouse the echoes from the Dent d’Hérens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We went on gaily,
        passed the second tent platform, the Chimney, and the other
        well-remembered points, and reckoned, confidently, on sleeping that
        night upon the top of <span class="tei tei-q">“the shoulder;”</span>
        but, before we had well arrived at the foot of the Great Tower, a
        sudden rush of cold air warned us to look out.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was difficult
        to say where this air came from; it did not blow as a wind, but
        descended rather as the water in a shower-bath! All was tranquil
        again; the atmosphere <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">showed</span></span> no signs of disturbance;
        there was a dead calm, and not a speck of cloud to be seen anywhere.
        But we did not remain very long in this state. The cold air came
        again, and this time it was difficult to say where it did
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></span> come from. We jammed down our
        hats as it beat against the ridge, and screamed amongst the crags.
        Before we had got to the foot of the Tower, mists had been formed
        above and below. They appeared at first in small, isolated patches
        (in several places at the same time), which danced and jerked and
        were torn into shreds by the wind, but grew larger under the process.
        They were united together, and rent again,—showing us the blue sky
        for a moment, and blotting it out the next; and augmented
        incessantly, until the whole heavens were filled with whirling,
        boiling clouds. Before we could take off our packs, and get under any
        kind of shelter, a hurricane of snow burst upon us from the east. It
        fell very heavily, and in a few minutes the ridge was covered by it.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What shall we do?”</span> I shouted to
        Carrel. <span class="tei tei-q">“Monsieur,”</span> said he,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the wind is bad; the weather has changed; we
        are heavily laden. Here is a fine <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gîte</span></span>; let
        us stop! If we go on we shall be half-frozen. That is <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">my</span></span>
        opinion.”</span> No one differed from him; so we fell to work to make
        a place for the tent, and in a couple of hours completed the platform
        which we had commenced in 1862. The clouds had blackened during that
        time, and we had hardly finished our task before a thunderstorm broke
        upon us with appalling fury. Forked <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>lightning shot out at the turrets above, and at
        the crags below. It was so close that we quailed at its darts. It
        seemed to scorch us,—we were in the very focus of the storm. The
        thunder was simultaneous with the flashes; short and sharp, and more
        like the noise of a door that is violently slammed, multiplied a
        thousandfold, than any noise to which I can compare it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When I say that
        the thunder was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">simultaneous</span></span> with the lightning, I
        speak as an inexact person. My meaning is that the time which elapsed
        between seeing the flash and hearing the report was inappreciable to
        me. I wish to speak with all possible precision, and there are two
        points with regard to this storm upon which I can speak with some
        accuracy. The first is in regard to the distance of the lightning
        from our party. We <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">might</span></span> have been 1100 feet from it
        if a second of time had elapsed between seeing the flashes and
        hearing the reports; and a second of time is not appreciated by
        inexact persons. It was certain that we were sometimes less than that
        distance from the lightning, because I saw it pass in front of
        well-known points on the ridge, both above and below us, which were
        less (sometimes considerably less) than a thousand feet distant.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Secondly, in
        regard to the difficulty of distinguishing sounds which are merely
        echoes from true thunder, or the noise which occurs simultaneously
        with lightning. Arago entered into this subject at some length in his
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Meteorological Essays</span></span>, and seemed
        to doubt if it would ever be possible to determine whether echoes are
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">always</span></span> the cause of the rolling
        sounds commonly called thunder.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83"
        href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> I shall
        not attempt to show whether the rolling sounds should ever, or never,
        be regarded as true thunder, but only that during this storm upon the
        Matterhorn it was possible to distinguish the sound of the thunder
        itself from the sounds (rolling and otherwise) which were merely the
        echoes of the first, original sound.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the place where
        we were camped a remarkable echo could be heard (one so remarkable
        that if it could be heard in this country it would draw crowds for
        its own sake); I believe it came from the cliffs of the Dent
        d’Hérens. It was a favourite amusement with us to shout to rouse this
        echo, which repeated any sharp cry, in a very distinct manner,
        several times, after the lapse of something like a dozen seconds. The
        thunderstorm lasted nearly two hours, and raged at times with great
        fury; and the prolonged rollings from the surrounding mountains,
        after one flash, had not usually ceased before another set of echoes
        took up the discourse, and maintained the reverberations without a
        break. Occasionally there was a pause, interrupted presently by a
        single clap, the accompaniment of a single discharge, and after such
        times I could recognise the echoes from the Dent d’Hérens by their
        peculiar repetitions, and by the length of time which had passed
        since the reports had occurred of which they were the echoes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If I had been
        unaware of the existence of this echo, I should have supposed that
        the resounds were original reports of explosions which had been
        unnoticed, since in intensity they were scarcely distinguishable from
        the true thunder; which, during this storm, seemed to me, upon every
        occasion, to consist of a single, harsh, instantaneous sound.<a id=

        being placed at a distance of less than a thousand feet from the
        points of explosion (and consequently hearing the report almost in
        the same moment as we saw the flash, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>and the rollings after a considerable interval
        of time), we had been placed so that the original report had fallen
        on our ears nearly at the same moment as the echoes, we should
        probably have considered that the successive reports and rollings of
        the echoes were reports of successive explosions occurring nearly at
        the same moment, and that they were not echoes at all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the only
        time (out of many storms witnessed in the Alps) I have obtained
        evidence that the rollings of thunder are actually echoes; and that
        they are not, necessarily, the reports of a number of discharges over
        a long line, occurring at varying distances from the spectator, and
        consequently unable to arrive at his ear at the same moment, although
        they follow each other so swiftly as to produce a sound more or less
        continuous.<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wind during
        all this time seemed to blow tolerably consistently from the east. It
        smote the tent so vehemently (notwithstanding it was partly protected
        by rocks) that we had grave fears our refuge might be blown away
        bodily, with ourselves inside; so, during some of the lulls, we
        issued out and built a wall to windward. At half-past three the wind
        changed to the north-west, and the clouds vanished. We immediately
        took the opportunity to send down one of the porters (under
        protection of some of the others, a little beyond the Col du Lion),
        as the tent would accommodate only five persons. From this time to
        sunset the weather was variable. It was sometimes blowing and snowing
        hard, and sometimes a dead calm. The bad weather was evidently
        confined to the Mont Cervin, for when the clouds lifted we could see
        every<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name=
        "Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thing that could be
        seen from our gîte. Monte Viso, a hundred miles off, was clear, and
        the sun set gorgeously behind the range of Mont Blanc. We passed the
        night comfortably—even luxuriously—in our blanket-bags, but there was
        little chance of sleeping, between the noise of the wind, of the
        thunder, and of the falling rocks. I forgave the thunder for the sake
        of the lightning. A more splendid spectacle than its illumination of
        the Matterhorn crags I do not expect to see.<a id="noteref_86" name=
        "noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The greatest
        rock-falls always seemed to occur in the night, between midnight and
        daybreak. This was noticeable on each of the seven nights which I
        passed upon the south-west ridge, at heights varying from 11,800 to
        13,000 feet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I may be wrong in
        supposing that the falls in the night are greater than those in the
        daytime, since sound is much more startling during darkness than when
        the cause of its production is seen. Even a sigh may be terrible in
        the stillness of the night. In the daytime one’s attention is
        probably divided between the sound and the motion of rocks which
        fall; or it may be concentrated on other matters. But it is certain
        that the greatest of the falls which happened during the night took
        place after midnight, and this I connect with the fact that the
        maximum of cold during any twenty-four hours very commonly occurs
        between midnight and dawn.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We turned out at
        3.30 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> on the 11th, and were dismayed to
        find that it still continued to snow. At 9 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> it
        ceased to fall, and the sun showed itself feebly, so we packed up our
        baggage, and set out to try to get upon <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        shoulder.”</span> We struggled upwards until eleven o’clock, and then
        it commenced to snow again. We held a council; the opinions expressed
        at it were unanimous against advancing, and I decided to retreat. For
        we had risen less than 300 feet in the past two hours, and had not
        even arrived at the rope which Tyndall’s party left behind, attached
        to the rocks, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg
        121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in
        1862. At the same rate of progression it would have taken us from
        four to five hours to get upon <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        shoulder.”</span> Not one of us cared to attempt to do so under the
        existing circumstances; for besides having to move our own weight,
        which was sufficiently troublesome at this part of the ridge, we had
        to transport much heavy baggage, tent, blankets, and provisions,
        ladder, and 450 feet of rope, besides many other smaller matters.
        These, however, were not the most serious considerations. Supposing
        that we got upon <span class="tei tei-q">“the shoulder,”</span> we
        might find ourselves detained there several days, unable either to go
        up or down.<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Why is it that the
        Matterhorn is subject to these abominable variations of weather? The
        ready answer is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, the mountain is so
        isolated; it attracts the clouds.”</span> This is not a sufficient
        answer. Although the mountain <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">is</span></span> isolated, it is not so much
        more isolated than the neighbouring peaks that it should gather
        clouds when none of the others do so. It will not at all account for
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name=
        "Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cloud to which I refer,
        which is not formed by an aggregation of smaller, stray clouds drawn
        together from a distance (as scum collects round a log in the water),
        but is created against the mountain itself, and springs into
        existence where no clouds were seen before. It is formed and hangs
        chiefly against the southern sides, and particularly against the
        south-eastern side. It frequently does not envelop the summit, and
        rarely extends down to the Glacier du Lion, and to the Glacier du
        Mont Cervin below. It forms in the finest weather; on cloudless and
        windless days.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I conceive that we
        should look to differences of temperature rather than to the height
        or isolation of the mountain for an explanation. I am inclined to
        attribute the disturbances which occur in the atmosphere of the
        southern sides of the Matterhorn on fine days,<a id="noteref_88"
        name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>
        principally to the fact that the mountain is a <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rock</span></span>
        mountain; that it receives a great amount of heat,<a id="noteref_89"
        name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a> and is
        not only warmer itself, but is surrounded by an atmosphere of a
        higher temperature than such peaks as the Weisshorn and the Lyskamm,
        which are eminently <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">snow</span></span> mountains.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In certain states
        of the atmosphere its temperature may be tolerably uniform over wide
        areas and to great elevations. I have known the thermometer to show
        70° in the shade at the top of an Alpine peak more than 13,000 feet
        high, and but a very few degrees higher 6000 or 7000 feet lower. At
        other times, there will be a difference of forty or fifty degrees
        (Faht.) between two stations, the higher not more than 6000 or 7000
        feet above the lower.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Provided that the
        temperature was uniform, or nearly so, on all sides of the
        Matterhorn, and to a considerable distance above its summit, no
        clouds would be likely to form upon it. But if the atmosphere
        immediately surrounding it is warmer than the contiguous strata, a
        local <span class="tei tei-q">“courant ascendant”</span> must
        necessarily be generated; and portions of the cooler superincumbent
        (or circum<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
        123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>jacent) air will naturally be attracted towards
        the mountain, where they will speedily condense the moisture of the
        warm air in contact with it. I cannot explain the downrushes of cold
        air which occur on it, when all the rest of the neighbourhood appears
        to be tranquil, in any other way. The clouds are produced by the
        contact of two strata of air (of widely different temperatures)
        charged with invisible moisture, as surely as certain colourless
        fluids produce a white, turbid liquid, when mixed together. The order
        has been—wind of a low temperature—mist—rain—snow or hail.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This opinion is
        borne out to some extent by the behaviour of the neighbouring
        mountains. The Dom (14,935 feet) and the Dent Blanche (14,318) have
        both of them large cliffs of bare rock upon their southern sides, and
        against those cliffs clouds commonly form (during fine, still
        weather) at the same time as the cloud on the Matterhorn; whilst the
        Weisshorn (14,804) and the Lyskamm (14,889), (mountains of about the
        same altitude, and which are in corresponding situations to the
        former pair) usually remain perfectly clear.</p><a name="fig41" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we arrived
        upon the highest summit of Mont Pelvoux, in Dauphiné, in 1861, we
        saw, to our surprise and disappointment, that it was not the
        culminating point of the district; and that another mountain—distant
        about a couple of miles, and separated from us by an impassable
        gulf—claimed that distinction. I was troubled in spirit about this
        mountain, and my thoughts often reverted to the great wall-sided
        peak, second in apparent inaccessibility only to the Matterhorn. It
        had, moreover, another claim to attention—it was the highest mountain
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The year 1862
        passed away without a chance of getting to it, and my holiday was too
        brief in 1863 even to think about it; but in the following year it
        was possible, and I resolved to set my mind at rest by completing the
        task which had been left unfinished in 1861.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime
        others had turned their attention to Dauphiné. First of all (in 1862)
        came Mr. F. Tuckett—that mighty mountaineer, whose name is known
        throughout the length and breadth of the Alps—with the guides Michel
        Croz, Peter Perrn, and Bartolommeo Peyrotte, and great success
        attended his arms. But Mr. Tuckett halted before the Pointe des
        Ecrins, and, dismayed by its appearance, withdrew his forces to
        gather less dangerous laurels elsewhere.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His expedition,
        however, threw some light upon the Ecrins. He pointed out the
        direction from which an attack was most likely to be successful, and

        his labours) attempted to execute the ascent, with the brothers
        Michel and J. B. Croz, by following his indications. But they too
        were defeated, as I shall relate more particularly

        with whom I travelled, Michel Croz was the man who was most after my
        own heart. He did not work like a blunt razor, and take to his toil
        unkindly. He did not need urging, or to be told a second time to do
        anything. You had but to say <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">what</span></span> was to be done, and
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">how</span></span> it was to be done, and the
        work <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">was</span></span> done, if it was possible. Such
        men are not common, and when they are known they are valued. Michel
        was not widely known, but those who did know him employed him again
        and again. The inscription that is placed upon his tomb truthfully
        records that he was <span class="tei tei-q">“beloved by his comrades
        and esteemed by travellers.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the time that I
        was planning my journey, my friends Messrs. A. W. Moore and Horace
        Walker were also drawing up their programme; and, as we found that
        our wishes were very similar, we agreed to unite our respective
        parties. The excursions which are described in this and the two
        following chapters are mutual ideas which were jointly executed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our united
        programme was framed so as to avoid sleeping in inns, and so that we
        should see from the highest point attained on one day a considerable
        portion of the route which was intended to be followed on the next.
        This latter matter was an important one to us, as all of our
        projected excursions were new ones, and led over ground about which
        there was very little information in print.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My friends had
        happily secured Christian Almer of Grindelwald as their guide. The
        combination of Croz and Almer was a perfect one. Both men were in the
        prime of life;<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href=
        "#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> both
        were endued with strength and activity far beyond the average; and
        the courage and the knowledge of each was alike undoubted. The temper
        of Almer it was impossible to ruffle; he was ever obliging and
        enduring,—a bold but a safe man. That which he lacked in fire—in
        dash—was supplied by Croz, who, in his turn, was kept in place by
        Almer. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name=
        "Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>It is pleasant to
        remember how they worked together, and how each one confided to you
        that he liked the other so much because he worked so well; but it is
        sad, very sad, to those who have known the men, to know that they can
        never work together again.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We met at St.
        Michel on the Mont Cenis road, at midday on June 20, 1864, and
        proceeded in the afternoon over the Col de Valloires to the village
        of the same name. The summit of this pretty little pass is about 3500
        feet above St. Michel, and from it we had a fair view of the
        Aiguilles d’Arve, a group of three peaks of singular form, which it
        was our especial object to investigate.<a id="noteref_92" name=
        "noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> They had
        been seen by ourselves and others from numerous distant points, and
        always looked very high and very inaccessible; but we had been unable
        to obtain any information about them, except the few words in
        Joanne’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Itinéraire du Dauphiné</span></span>. Having
        made out from the summit of the Col de Valloires that they could be
        approached from the Valley of Valloires, we hastened down to find a
        place where we could pass the night, as near as possible to the
        entrance of the little valley leading up to them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By nightfall we
        arrived at the entrance to this little valley (Vallon des Aiguilles
        d’Arve), and found some buildings placed just where they were wanted.
        The proprietress received us with civility, and placed a large barn
        at our disposal, on the conditions that no lights were struck or
        pipes smoked therein; and when her terms were agreed to, she took us
        into her own chalet, made up a huge fire, heated a gallon of milk,
        and treated us with genuine hospitality.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the morning we
        found that the Vallon des Aiguilles d’Arve led away nearly due west
        from the Valley of Valloires, and that the village of Bonnenuit was
        placed (in the latter valley) almost exactly opposite to the junction
        of the two.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At 3.55
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> on the 21st we set out up the
        Vallon, passed for a time over pasture-land, and then over a stony
        waste, deeply chan<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg
        128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class=

        principal Aiguilles were well seen, and as, by this time, it was
        evident that the authors of the Sardinian official map had romanced
        as extensively in this neighbourhood as elsewhere, it was necessary
        to hold a council.</p><a name="ill128" id="ill128" class=

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=
        "images/illus165.png" alt="Illustration: Plan to show route" /></div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three questions
        were submitted to it:—Firstly, Which is the highest of these
        Aiguilles? Secondly, Which shall we go up? Thirdly, How is it to be
        done?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The French
        engineers, it was said, had determined that the two highest of them
        were respectively 11,513 and 11,529 feet in height; but we were
        without information as to which two they had measured.<a id=
        "noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> Joanne
        indeed said (but without specifying whether he meant all three) that
        the Aiguilles had been several times ascended, and particularly
        mentioned that the one of 11,513 feet was <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“relatively easy.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We therefore said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We will go up the peak of 11,529
        feet.”</span> That determination did not settle the second question.
        Joanne’s <span class="tei tei-q">“relatively easy”</span> peak,
        according to his description, was evidently the most northern of the
        three. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Our</span></span> peak then was to be one of the
        other two;—but which of them? We were inclined to favour the central
        one; but it was hard to determine, they looked so equal in height.
        When, however, the council came to study the third <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>question—<span class="tei tei-q">“How is
        it to be done?”</span> it was unanimously voted that upon the eastern
        and southern sides it was certainly <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“relatively”</span> difficult, and that a move should be
        made round to the northern side.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The movement was
        duly executed, and after wading up some snow-slopes of considerable
        steepness (going occasionally beyond 40°), we found ourselves in a
        gap or nick, between the central and northernmost Aiguille, at 8.45
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> We then studied the northern face
        of our intended peak, and finally arrived at the conclusion that it
        was <span class="tei tei-q">“relatively”</span> impracticable. Croz
        shrugged his big shoulders, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“My
        faith! I think you will do well to leave it to others.”</span> Almer
        was more explicit, and volunteered the information that a thousand
        francs would not tempt him to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">try</span></span> it. We then turned to the
        northernmost peak, but found its southern faces even more hopeless
        than the northern faces of the central one. We enjoyed accordingly
        the unwonted luxury of a three-hours’ rest on the top of our pass;
        for pass we were determined it should be.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We might have done
        worse. We were 10,300 or 10,400 feet above the level of the sea, and
        commanded a most picturesque view of the mountains of the Tarentaise;
        while, somewhat east of south, we saw the monarch of the Dauphiné
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">massif</span></span>, whose closer acquaintance
        it was our intention to make. Three sunny hours passed away, and then
        we turned to the descent. We saw the distant pastures of a valley
        (which we supposed was the Vallon or Ravine de la Sausse), and a long
        snow-slope leading down to them. But from that slope we were cut off
        by precipitous rocks, and our first impression was that we should
        have to return in our track. Some running up and down, however,
        discovered two little gullies, filled with threads of snow, and down
        the most northern of these we decided to go. It was a steep way but a
        safe one, for the cleft was so narrow that we could press the
        shoulder against one side whilst the feet were against the other, and
        the last remnant of the winter’s snow, well hardened, clung to the
        rift with great tenacity, and gave us a path when the rocks refused
        one. In half-an-hour we got to the top of the great snow-slope.
        Walker said—<span class="tei tei-q">“Let us <span class="tei tei-pb"

        "tei tei-q">“No, it is too steep.”</span> Our friend, however,
        started off at a standing glissade, and advanced for a time very
        skilfully; but after a while he lost his balance, and progressed
        downwards and backwards with great rapidity, in a way that seemed to
        us very much like tumbling head over heels. He let go his axe, and
        left it behind, but it overtook him and batted him heartily. He and
        it travelled in this fashion for some hundreds of feet, and at last
        subsided into the rocks at the bottom. In a few moments we were
        reassured as to his safety, by hearing him ironically request us not
        to keep him waiting down there.</p><a name="fig44" id="fig44" class=

        friend at the bottom. We then turned sharply to the left, and tramped
        down the summit ridge of an old moraine of great size. Its mud was
        excessively <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg

        with our ice-axes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Guided by the
        sound of a distant <span class="tei tei-q">“moo,”</span> we speedily
        found the highest chalets in the valley, named Rieu Blanc. They were
        tenanted by three old women (who seemed to belong to one of the
        missing links sought by naturalists), destitute of all ideas except
        in regard to cows, and who spoke a barbarous patois, well-nigh
        unintelligible to the Savoyard Croz. They would not believe that we
        had passed between the Aiguilles,—<span class="tei tei-q">“It is
        impossible, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cows</span></span> never go there.”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Could we get to La Grave over yonder
        ridge?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh yes! the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cows</span></span>
        often crossed!”</span> Could they show us the way? No; but we could
        follow the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cow</span></span>-tracks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We stayed a while
        near these chalets, to examine the western sides of the Aiguilles
        d’Arve, and, according to our united opinion, the central one was as
        inaccessible from this direction as from the east, north, or south.
        On the following day we saw them again, from a height of about 11,000
        feet, in a south-easterly direction, and our opinion remained
        unchanged.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We saw (on June
        20-22) the central Aiguille from all sides, and very nearly
        completely round the southernmost one. The northern one we also saw
        on all sides excepting from the north. (It is, however, precisely
        from this direction M. Joanne says that its ascent is relatively
        easy.) We do not, therefore, venture to express any opinion
        respecting its ascent, except as regards its actual summit. This is
        formed of two curious prongs, or pinnacles of rock, and we do not
        understand in what way they (or either of them) can be ascended; nor
        shall we be surprised if this ascent is discovered to have been made
        in spirit rather than body; in fact, in the same manner as the
        celebrated ascent of Mont Blanc, <span class="tei tei-q">“not
        entirely to the summit, but as far as the Montanvert!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All three of the
        Aiguilles <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">may</span></span> be accessible, but they
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">look</span></span> as inaccessible as anything I
        have seen. They are the highest summits between the valleys of the
        Romanche and the Arc; they are placed slightly to the north of the
        watershed between those <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg
        132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>two
        valleys, and a line drawn through them runs, pretty nearly, north and
        south.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We descended by a
        rough path from Rieu Blanc to the chalets of La Sausse, which give
        the name to the Vallon or Ravine de la Sausse, in which they are
        situated. This is one of the numerous branches of the valley that
        descends to St. Jean d’Arve, and subsequently to St. Jean de
        Maurienne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two passes, more
        or less known, lead from this valley to the village of La Grave (on
        the Lautaret road) in the valley of the Romanche, viz.:—the Col de
        l’Infernet and the Col de Martignare. The former pass was crossed,
        many years ago, by J. D. Forbes, and was mentioned by him in his
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Norway and
        its Glaciers</span></span>. The latter one lies to the north of the
        former, and is seldom traversed by tourists, but it was convenient
        for us, and we set out to cross it on the morning of the 22d, after
        having passed a comfortable, but not luxurious, night in the hay, at
        La Sausse, where, however, the simplicity of the accommodation was
        more than counterbalanced by the civility and hospitality of the
        people in charge.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">[Our object now
        was to cross to La Grave (on the high road from Grenoble to
        Briançon), and to ascend, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        high to give us a good view of the Dauphiné Alps in general, and of
        the grand chain of the Meije in particular. Before <span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Joanne”</span> had elicited the fact that
        the shortest route from La Sausse to La Grave was by the Col de
        Martignare; and also that from the aforesaid Col it was possible to
        ascend a lofty summit, called by him the Bec-du-Grenier, also called
        Aiguille de Goléon. On referring, however, to the Sardinian survey,
        we found there depicted, to the east of the Col de Martignare, not
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">one</span></span> peak bearing the above
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        summits</span></span>; one—just above the Col—the Bec-du-Grenier (the
        height of which was not stated); the other, still farther to the
        east, and somewhat to the south of the watershed—the Aiguille du
        Goléon (11,250 English feet in height), with a very considerable
        glacier—the Glacier Lombard—between the two. On the French map,<a id=

        other hand, neither of the above names was to be found, but a peak
        called Aiguille de la Sausse (10,897 feet), was placed in the
        position assigned to the Bec-du-Grenier in the Sardinian map; while
        farther to the east was a second and nameless peak (10,841), not at
        all in the position given to the Aiguille du Goléon, of which and of
        the Glacier Lombard there was not a sign. All this was very puzzling
        and unsatisfactory; but as we had no doubt of being able to climb one
        of the points to the east of the Col de Martignare (which overhung
        the Ravine de la Sausse), we determined to make that col the basis of
        our operations.]<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href=

        from our hostesses], proceeded at first towards the upper end of the
        ravine, then doubled back up a long buttress which projects in an
        unusual way, and went towards the Col de Martignare; but before
        arriving at its summit we again doubled, and resumed the <span class=

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> we stood on the watershed, and
        followed it towards the east; keeping for some distance strictly to
        the ridge, and afterwards diverging a little to the south to avoid a
        considerable secondary aiguille, which prevented a straight track
        being made to the summit at which we were aiming. At 9.15 we stood on
        its top, and saw at once the lay of the land.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We found that our
        peak was one of four which enclosed a plateau that was filled by a
        glacier. Let us call these summits <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">A</span></span>,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">B</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">C</span></span>,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">D</span></span> (see plan on <a href="#fig43"
        class="tei tei-ref">p. 128</a>). We stood upon <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">C</span></span>, which
        was almost exactly the same elevation as <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">B</span></span>, but was
        higher than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">D</span></span>, and lower than <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">A</span></span>. Peak
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">A</span></span> was the highest of the four, and
        was about 200 feet higher than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">B</span></span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">C</span></span>; we
        identified it as the Aiguille de Goléon (French survey, 11,250 feet).
        Peak <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">D</span></span> we considered was the
        Bec-du-Grenier; and, in default of other names, we called
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">B</span></span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">C</span></span> the
        Aiguilles de la Sausse. The glacier flowed in a south-easterly
        direction, and was the Glacier Lombard.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peaks <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">B</span></span> and
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">C</span></span> overhung the Ravine de la Sausse,
        and were connected with another aiguille—<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">E</span></span>—which did
        the same. A continuation of the ridge out of which these three
        aiguilles rose joined the Aiguilles d’Arve. The head of the Ravine de
        la Sausse was therefore encircled by six peaks; three of which it was
        convenient to term the Aiguilles de la Sausse, and the others were
        the Aiguilles d’Arve.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We were very
        fortunate in the selection of our summit. Not to speak of other
        things, it gave a grand view of the ridge which culminates in the
        peak called La Meije (13,080 feet), which used to be mentioned by
        travellers under the name Aiguille du Midi de la Grave. The view of
        this mountain from the village of La Grave itself can hardly be
        praised too highly,—it is one of the very finest road-views in the
        Alps. The Ortler Spitz from the Stelvio is, in fact, its only worthy
        competitor; and the opinions generally of <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>those who have seen the two views are in favour
        of the former. But from La Grave one can no more appreciate the noble
        proportions and the towering height of the Meije, than understand the
        symmetry of the dome of St. Paul’s by gazing upon it from the
        churchyard. To see it fairly, one must be placed at a greater
        distance and at a greater height.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I shall not try to
        describe the Meije. The same words, and the same phrases, have to do
        duty for one and another mountain; their repetition becomes
        wearisome; and ’tis a discouraging fact that any description, however
        true or however elaborated, seldom or never gives an idea of the
        reality.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the Meije
        deserves more than a passing notice. It was the last great Alpine
        peak which knew the foot of man, and one can scarcely speak in
        exaggerated terms of its jagged ridges, torrential glaciers, and
        tremendous precipices.<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href=
        "#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> But were
        I to discourse upon these things without the aid of pictures, or to
        endeavour to convey in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">words</span></span> a sense of the loveliness of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">curves</span></span>, of the beauty of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sound</span></span>, I should try to accomplish
        that which is impossible; and, at the best, should succeed in but
        giving an impression that the things spoken of may have been pleasant
        to hear or to behold, although they are perfectly incomprehensible to
        read about. Let me therefore avoid these <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>things, not because I have no love for or
        thought of them, but because they cannot be translated into language;
        and presently, when topographical details must, of necessity, be
        returned to again, I will endeavour to relieve the poverty of the pen
        by a free use of the pencil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst we sat upon
        the Aiguille de la Sausse, our attention was concentrated on a point
        that was immediately opposite—on a gap or cleft between the Meije and
        the mountain called the Rateau. It was, indeed, in order to have a
        good view of this place that we made the ascent of the Aiguille. It
        (that is the gap itself) looked, as my companions remarked,
        obtrusively and offensively a pass. It had not been crossed, but it
        ought to have been; and this seemed to have been recognised by the
        natives, who called it, very appropriately, the Brèche de la
        Meije.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had seen the
        place in 1860, and again in 1861, but had not then thought about
        getting through it; and our information in respect to it was chiefly
        derived from a photographic reproduction of the then unpublished
        sheet 189, of the great map of France, which Mr. Tuckett, with his
        usual liberality, had placed at our disposal. It was evident from
        this map that if we could succeed in passing the Brèche, we should
        make the most direct route between the village of La Grave and that
        of Bérarde in the Department of the Isère, and that the distance
        between these two places by this route, would be less than one-third
        that of the ordinary way via the villages of Freney and Venos. It may
        occur to some of my readers, why had it not been done before? For the
        very sound reason that the valley on its southern side (Vallon des
        Etançons) is uninhabited, and La Bérarde itself is a miserable
        village, without interest, without commerce, and almost without
        population. Why then did we wish to cross it? Because we were bound
        to the Pointe des Ecrins, to which La Bérarde was the nearest
        inhabited place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we sat upon
        the Aiguille de la Sausse, we were rather despondent about our
        prospects of crossing the Brèche, which seemed to present a
        combination of all that was formidable. There <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was, evidently, but one way by which it
        could be approached. We saw that at the top of the pass there was a
        steep wall of snow or ice (so steep that it was most likely ice)
        protected at its base by a big schrund or moat, which severed it from
        the snow-fields below. Then (tracking our course downwards) we saw
        undulating snow-fields leading down to a great glacier. The
        snow-fields would be easy work, but the glacier was riven and broken
        in every direction; huge crevasses seemed to extend entirely across
        it in some places, and everywhere it had that strange twisted look,
        which tells of the unequal motion of the ice. Where could we get on
        to it? At its base it came to a violent end, being cut short by a
        cliff, over which it poured periodical avalanches, as we saw by a
        great triangular bed of débris below. We could not venture there,—the
        glacier must be taken in flank. But on which side? Not on the
        west,—no one could climb those cliffs. It must, if any where, be by
        the rocks on the east; and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">they</span></span> looked as if they were
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">roches
        moutonnées</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So we hurried down
        to La Grave, to hear what Melchior Anderegg (who had just passed
        through the village with the family of our friend Walker) had to say
        on the matter. Who is Melchior Anderegg? Those who ask the question
        cannot have been in Alpine Switzerland, where the name of Melchior is
        as well known as the name of Napoleon. Melchior, too, is an Emperor
        in his way—a very Prince among guides. His empire is amongst the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal snows,”</span>—his sceptre is an
        ice-axe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Melchior Anderegg,
        more familiarly, and perhaps more generally known simply as Melchior,
        was born at Zaun, near Meiringen, on April 6, 1828. He was first
        brought into public notice in Hinchcliff’s <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Summer Months in the
        Alps</span></span>, and was known to very few persons at the time
        that little work was published. In 1855 he was <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Boots”</span> at the Grimsel Hotel, and in those days,
        when he went out on expeditions, it was for the benefit of his
        master, the proprietor; Melchior himself only got the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">trinkgelt</span></span>. In 1856 he migrated to
        the Schwarenbach Inn on <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg
        138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        Gemmi, where he employed his time in carving objects for sale. In
        1858 he made numerous expeditions with Messrs. Hinchcliff and
        Stephen, and proved to his employers that he possessed first-rate
        skill, indomitable courage, and an admirable character. His position
        has never been doubtful since that year, and for a long time there
        has been no guide whose services have been more in request: he is
        usually engaged a year in advance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be almost
        an easier task to say what he has not done than to catalogue his
        achievements. Invariable success attends his arms; he leads his
        followers to victory, but not to death. I believe that no serious
        accident has ever befallen travellers in his charge. Like his friend
        Almer, he can be called a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">safe</span></span> man. It is the highest praise
        that can be given to a first-rate guide.</p><a name="fig45" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in the
        afternoon we found ourselves in the little inn at La Grave, on the
        great Lautaret road, a rickety, tumble-down sort of place, with
        nothing stable about it, as Moore wittily remarked, except the
        smell.<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href=
        "#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        had gone, and had left <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg
        139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>behind a note which said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I think the passage of the Brèche is possible, but that
        it will be very difficult.”</span> His opinion coincided with ours,
        and we went to sleep, expecting to be afoot about eighteen or twenty
        hours on the morrow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At 2.40 the next
        morning we left La Grave, in a few minutes crossed the Romanche, and
        at 4 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> got to the moraine of the eastern
        branch of the glacier that descends from the Brèche.<a id=
        "noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> The
        rocks by which we intended to ascend were placed between the two
        branches of this glacier, and still looked smooth and unbroken. By 5
        o’clock we were upon them, and saw that we had been deluded by them.
        No carpenter could have planned a more convenient staircase. They
        were <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">not
        moutonnée</span></span>, their smooth look from a distance was only
        owing to their singular firmness. [It was really quite a pleasure to
        scale such delightful rocks. We felt the stone held the boot so well,
        that, without making a positive effort to do so, it would be almost
        impossible to slip.] In an hour we had risen above the most crevassed
        portion of the glacier, and began to look for a way on to it. Just at
        the right place there was a patch of old snow at the side, and,
        instead of gaining the ice by desperate acrobatic feats, we passed
        from the rocks on to it as easily as one walks across a gangway. At
        half-past 6 we were on the centre of the glacier, and the inhabitants
        of La Grave turned out <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">en masse</span></span> into the road, and
        watched us with amazement as they witnessed the falsification of
        their confident predictions. Well might they stare, for our little
        caravan, looking to them like a train of flies on a wall, crept up
        and up, without hesitation and without a halt—lost to their sight one
        minute as it dived into a crevasse, then seen again clambering up the
        other side. The higher we rose the easier became the work, the angles
        lessened, and our pace increased. The snow remained shadowed, and we
        walked as easily as on a high road; and when (at 7.45) the summit of
        the Brèche was seen, we rushed at it as furiously <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as if it had been a breach in the wall of
        a fortress, carried the moat by a dash, with a push behind and a pull
        before, stormed the steep slope above, and at 8.50 stood in the
        little gap, 11,054 feet above the level of the sea. The Brèche was
        won. Well might they stare; five hours and a quarter had sufficed for
        6500 feet of ascent.<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All mountaineers
        know how valuable it is to study beforehand an intended route over
        new ground from a height at some distance. None but blunderers fail
        to do so, if it is possible; and one cannot do so too thoroughly. As
        a rule, the closer one approaches underneath a summit, the more
        difficult it is to pick out a path with judgment. Inferior peaks seem
        unduly important, subordinate ridges are exalted, and slopes conceal
        points beyond; and if one blindly undertakes an ascent, without
        having acquired a tolerable notion of the relative importance of the
        parts, and of their positions to one another, it will be miraculous
        if great difficulties are not encountered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But although the
        examination of an intended route from a height at a distance will
        tell one (who knows the meaning of the things he is looking at) a
        good deal, and will enable him to steer clear of many difficulties
        against which he might otherwise blindly run, it will seldom allow
        one to pronounce positively upon the practicability or
        impracticability of the whole of the route. No living man, for
        example, can pronounce positively from a distance <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in regard to rocks. Those just mentioned
        are an illustration of this. Three of the ablest and most experienced
        guides concurred in thinking that they would be found very difficult,
        and yet they presented no difficulty whatever. In truth, the sounder
        and less broken up are the rocks, the more impracticable do they
        usually look from a distance; while soft and easily rent rocks, which
        are often amongst the most difficult and perilous to climb, very
        frequently look from afar as if they might be traversed by a
        child.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is possible to
        decide with greater certainty in regard to the practicability of
        glaciers. When one is seen to have few open crevasses (and this may
        be told from a great distance), then we know that it is <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">possible</span></span>
        to traverse it; but to what extent it, or a glacier that is much
        broken up by crevasses, will be troublesome, will depend upon the
        width and length of the crevasses, and upon the angles of the surface
        of the glacier itself. A glacier may be greatly crevassed, but the
        fissures may be so narrow that there is no occasion to deviate from a
        straight line when passing across them; or a glacier may have few
        open crevasses, and yet may be practically impassable on account of
        the steepness of the angles of its surface. Nominally, a man with an
        axe can go anywhere upon a glacier, but in practice it is found that
        to move freely upon ice one must have to deal only with small angles.
        It is thus necessary to know approximately the angles of the surfaces
        of a glacier before it is possible to determine whether it will
        afford easy travelling, or will be so difficult as to be (for all
        practical purposes) impassable. This cannot be told by looking at
        glaciers in full face from a distance; they must be seen in profile;
        and it is often desirable to examine them both from the front and in
        profile,—to do the first to study the direction of the crevasses, to
        note where they are most and least numerous; and the second to see
        whether its angles are moderate or great. Should they be very steep,
        it may be better to avoid them altogether, and to mount even by
        difficult rocks; but upon glaciers of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gentle</span></span>
        inclination, and with few open crevasses, better progress can always
        be made than upon the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So much to explain
        why we were deceived when looking at the Brèche de la Meije from the
        Aiguille de la Sausse. We took note of all the difficulties, but did
        not pay sufficient attention to the distance that the Brèche was
        south of La Grave. My meaning will be apparent from the accompanying
        <a href="#fig47" class="tei tei-ref">diagram</a>, Fig. 1 (constructed
        upon the data supplied by the French surveyors), which will also
        serve to illustrate how badly angles of elevation are judged by the
        unaided eye.</p><a name="fig47" id="fig47" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The village of La
        Grave is just 5000 feet, and the highest summit of the Meije is
        13,080 feet above the level of the sea. There is therefore a
        difference in their levels of 8080 feet. But the summit of the Meije
        is south of La Grave about 14,750 feet, and, consequently, a line
        drawn from La Grave to the summit of the Meije is no steeper than the
        dotted line drawn from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">A</span></span> to <span class=

        "#fig47" class="tei tei-ref">Fig. 1</a>; or, in other words, if one
        could go in a direct line from La Grave to the summit of the Meije
        the ascent would be at an angle of less than 30°. Nine persons out of
        ten would probably estimate the angle on the spot at double this
        amount.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Brèche is 2000
        feet below the summit of the Meije, and only 6000 feet above La
        Grave. A direct ascent from the village to the Brèche would
        consequently be at an angle of not much more than 20°. But it is not
        possible to make the ascent as the crow flies; it has to be made by
        an indirect and much longer route. Our track was probably double the
        length of a direct line between the two places. Doubling the length
        halved the angles, and we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg

        conclusion, that upon this, one of the steepest passes in the Alps,
        the mean of all the angles upon the ascent could not have been
        greater than 11° or 12°. Of course, in some places, the angles were
        much steeper, and in others less, but the <span class=

        ourselves much with these matters when we sat on the top of the
        Brèche. Our day’s work was as good as over (for we knew from Messrs.
        Mathews and Bonney that there was no difficulty upon the other side),
        and we abandoned ourselves to ease and luxury; wondering,
        alternately, as we gazed upon the Rateau and the Ecrins, how the one
        mountain could <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg

        seemed as if a puff of wind or a clap of thunder might dash the whole
        fabric to pieces]; while the latter asserted itself the monarch of
        the group, and towered head and shoulders above all the rest of the
        peaks which form the great horse-shoe of Dauphiné. At length a cruel
        rush of cold air made us shiver, and shift our quarters to a little
        grassy plot, 3000 feet below—an oasis in a desert—where we lay nearly
        four hours admiring the splendid wall of the Meije.<a id=

        tramped down the Vallon des Etançons, a howling wilderness, the
        abomination of desolation; destitute alike of animal or vegetable
        life; pathless, of course; suggestive of chaos, but of little else;
        covered almost throughout its entire length with débris from the size
        of a walnut up to that of a house; in a word, it looked as if
        half-a-dozen moraines of first-rate dimensions had been carted and
        shot into it. Our tempers were soured by constant pitfalls [it was
        impossible to take the eyes from the feet, and if an unlucky
        individual so much as blew his nose, without standing still to
        perform the operation, the result was either an instantaneous tumble,
        or a barked shin, or a half-twisted ankle. There was no end to it,
        and we became more savage at every step, unanimously agreeing that no
        power on earth would ever induce us to walk up or down this
        particular valley again.] It was not just to the valley, which was
        enclosed by noble mountains,—unknown, it is true, but worthy of a
        great reputation, and which, if placed in other districts, would be
        sought after, and cited as types of daring form and graceful

        on the afternoon of June 23, we were trotting down the steep path
        that leads into La Bérarde. We put up, of course, with the
        chasseur-guide Rodier (who, as usual, was smooth and smiling), and,
        after congratulations were over, we returned to the exterior to watch
        for the arrival of one Alexander Pic, who had been sent overnight
        with our baggage <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">viâ</span></span> Freney and Venos. But when the
        night fell, and no Pic appeared, we saw that our plans must be
        modified; for he was necessary to our very existence—he carried our
        food, our tobacco, our all. So, after some discussion, it was agreed
        that a portion of our programme should be abandoned, that the night
        of the 24th should be passed at the head of the Glacier de la Bonne
        Pierre, and that, on the 25th, a push should be made for the summit
        of the Ecrins. We then went to straw.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our porter Pic
        strolled in next morning with a very jaunty air, and we seized upon
        our tooth-brushes; but, upon looking for the cigars, we found
        starvation staring us in the face. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hullo!
        Monsieur Pic, where are our cigars?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Gentlemen,”</span> he began, <span class="tei tei-q">“I

        about a fit on the road, of brigands, thieves, of their ransacking
        the knap<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name=

        inquired secretly if he was known to smoke, and found that he was.

        Bonne Pierre, accompanied by Rodier, who staggered under a load of

        however, avoided the difficulties he experienced with the latter by
        crossing them high up, where they were subdivided. But when we got on
        to the moraine on the right bank of the glacier (or, properly
        speaking, on to one of the moraines, for there are several), mists
        descended, to our great hindrance; and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>it was 5.30 before we arrived on the spot at
        which it was intended to camp.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each one selected
        his nook, and we then joined round a grand fire made by our men.
        Fortnum and Mason’s portable soup was sliced up and brewed, and was
        excellent; but it should be said that before it <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></span>
        excellent, three times the quantity named in the directions had to be
        used. Art is required in drinking as in making this soup, and one
        point is this—always let your friends drink first; not only because
        it is more polite, but because the soup has a tendency to burn the
        mouth if taken too hot, and one drink of the bottom is worth two of
        the top, as all the goodness settles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">[While engaged in
        these operations, the mist that enveloped the glacier and surrounding
        peaks was becoming thinner; little bits of blue sky appeared here and
        there, until suddenly, when we were looking towards the head of the
        glacier, far, far above us, at an almost inconceivable height, in a
        tiny patch of blue, appeared a wonderful rocky pinnacle, bathed in
        the beams of the fast-sinking sun. We were so electrified by the
        glory of the sight that it was some seconds before we realised what
        we saw, and understood that that astounding point, removed apparently
        miles from the earth, was one of the highest summits of Les Ecrins;
        and that we hoped, before another sun had set, to have stood upon an
        even loftier pinnacle. The mists rose and fell, presenting us with a
        series of dissolving views of ravishing grandeur, and finally died
        away, leaving the glacier and its mighty bounding precipices under an
        exquisite pale blue sky, free from a single speck of cloud.]</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The night passed
        over without anything worth mention, but we had had occasion to
        observe in the morning an instance of the curious evaporation that is
        frequently noticeable in the High Alps. On the previous night we had
        hung up on a knob of rock our mackintosh bag containing five bottles
        of Rodier’s bad wine. In the morning, although the stopper appeared
        to have been in all night, about four-fifths had evaporated. It was
        strange; my friends <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg
        148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had
        not taken any, neither had I, and the guides each declared that they
        had not seen any one touch it. In fact it was clear that there was no
        explanation of the phenomenon, but in the dryness of the air. Still
        it is remarkable that the dryness of the air (or the evaporation of
        wine) is always greatest when a stranger is in one’s party—the
        dryness caused by the presence of even a single Chamounix porter is
        sometimes so great, that not four-fifths but the entire quantity
        disappears. For a time I found difficulty in combating this
        phenomenon, but at last discovered that if I used the wine-flask as a
        pillow during the night, the evaporation was completely stopped.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At 4 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> we moved
        off across the glacier in single file towards the foot of a great
        gully, which led from the upper slopes of the glacier de la Bonne
        Pierre, to the lowest point in the ridge that runs from the Ecrins to
        the mountain called Roche Faurio,—cheered by Rodier, who now returned
        with his wraps to La Bérarde. This gully (or <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">couloir</span></span>)
        was discovered and descended by Mr. Tuckett, and we will now return
        for a minute to the explorations of that accomplished
        mountaineer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the year 1862
        he had the good fortune to obtain from the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dépôt de la
        Guerre</span></span> at Paris, a MS. copy of the then unpublished
        sheet 189 of the map of France, and with it in hand, he swept
        backwards and forwards across the central Dauphiné Alps, untroubled
        by the doubts as to the identity of peaks, which had perplexed Mr.
        Macdonald and myself in 1861; and, enlightened by it, he was able to
        point out (which he did in the fairest manner) that we had confounded
        the Ecrins with another mountain—the Pic Sans Nom. We made this
        blunder through imperfect knowledge of the district and inaccurate
        reports of the natives;—but it was not an extraordinary one (the two
        mountains are not unlike each other), considering the difficulty that
        there is in obtaining from any except the very highest summits a
        complete view of this intricate group.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The situations of

        portion of sheet 189. The main ridge of the chain runs, at this part,
        nearly north and south. Roche Faurio, at the northern extreme, is
        3716 mètres, or 12,192 feet, above the level of the sea. The lowest
        point between that mountain and the Ecrins (the Col des Ecrins) is
        11,000 feet. The ridge again rises, and passes 13,000 feet in the
        neighbourhood of the Ecrins. The highest summit of that mountain
        (13,462 feet) is, however, placed a little to the east of and off the
        main ridge. It then again falls, and in the vicinity of the Col de la
        Tempe it is, perhaps, below 11,000 feet; but immediately to the south
        of the summit of that pass, there is upon the ridge a point which has
        been determined by the French surveyors to be 12,323 feet. This peak
        is without a name. The ridge continues to gain height as we come to
        the south, and culminates in the mountain which the French surveyors
        have called Sommet de l’Aile Froide. On the spot it is called, very
        commonly, the Aléfroide.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is some
        uncertainty respecting the elevation of this mountain. The Frenchmen
        give 3925 mètres (12,878) as its highest point, but Mr. Tuckett, who
        took a good theodolite to the top of Mont Pelvoux (which he agreed
        with his predecessors had an elevation of 12,973 feet), found that
        the summit of the Aléfroide was elevated above his station 4′; and as
        the distance between the two points was 12,467 feet, this would
        represent a difference in altitude of 5 mètres in favour of the
        Aléfroide. I saw this mountain from the summit of Mont Pelvoux in
        1861, and was in doubt as to which of the two was the higher, and in
        1864, from the summit of the Pointe des Ecrins (as will presently be
        related), it looked actually higher than Mont Pelvoux. I have
        therefore little doubt but that Mr. Tuckett is right in believing the
        Aléfroide to have an elevation of about 13,000 feet, instead of
        12,878, as determined by the French surveyors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mont Pelvoux is to
        the east of the Aléfroide and off the main ridge, and the Pic Sans
        Nom (12,845 feet) is placed between these two mountains. The latter
        is one of the grandest of the Dauphiné <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>peaks, but it is shut in by the other mountains,
        and is seldom seen except from a distance, and then is usually
        confounded with the neighbouring summits. Its name has been
        accidentally omitted on the map, but its situation is represented by
        the large patch of rocks, nearly surrounded by glaciers, that is seen
        between the words Ailefroide and Mt. Pelvoux.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lowest
        depression on the main ridge to the south of the Aléfroide is the Col
        du Selé, and this, according to Mr. Tuckett, is 10,834 feet. The
        ridge soon rises again, and, a little farther to the south, joins
        another ridge running nearly east and west. To a mountain at the
        junction of these two ridges the Frenchmen have given the singular
        name Crête des Bœufs Rouges! The highest point hereabouts is 11,332
        feet; and a little to the west there is another peak (Mont Bans) of
        11,979 feet. The main ridge runs from this last-named point, in a
        north-westerly direction, to the Cols de Says, both of which exceed
        10,000 feet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will thus be
        seen that the general elevation of this main ridge is almost equal to
        that of the range of Mont Blanc, or of the central Pennine Alps; and
        if we were to follow it out more completely, or to follow the other
        ridges surrounding or radiating from it, we should find that there is
        a remarkable absence, throughout the entire district, of low gaps and
        depressions, and that there are an extraordinary number of peaks of
        medium elevation.<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href=
        "#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a> The
        difficulty which explorers have experienced in Dauphiné in
        identifying peaks, has very much arisen from the elevation of the
        ridges generally being more uniform than is commonly found in the
        Alps, and the consequent facile concealment of one point by another.
        The difficulty has been enhanced by the narrowness and erratic
        courses of the valleys.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The possession of
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“advanced copy”</span> of sheet 189 of
        the French map, enabled Mr. Tuckett to grasp most of what I have just
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151"
        id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>said, and much more; and he
        added, in 1862, three interesting passes across this part of the
        chain to those already known. The first, from Ville Vallouise to La
        Bérarde, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">viâ</span></span> the village of Claux, and the
        glaciers du Selé and de la Pilatte,—this he called the Col du Selé;
        the second, between Ville Vallouise and Villar d’Arène (on the
        Lautaret road) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">viâ</span></span> Claux and the glaciers Blanc
        and d’Arsine,—the Col du Glacier Blanc; and the third, from Vallouise
        to La Bérarde, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">viâ</span></span> the Glacier Blanc, the Glacier
        de l’Encula, and the Glacier de la Bonne Pierre, the Col des
        Ecrins.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This last pass was
        discovered accidentally. Mr. Tuckett set out intending to endeavour
        to ascend the Pointe des Ecrins, but circumstances were against him,
        as he relates in the following words:—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Arrived on the plateau”</span> (of the Glacier de
        l’Encula), <span class="tei tei-q">“a most striking view of the
        Ecrins burst upon us, and a hasty inspection encouraged us to hope
        that its ascent would be practicable. On the sides of La Bérarde and
        the Glacier Noir it presents, as has been already stated, the most
        precipitous and inaccessible faces that can well be conceived; but in
        the direction of the Glacier de l’Encula, as the upper plateau of the
        Glacier Blanc is named on the French map, the slopes are less rapid,
        and immense masses of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">névé</span></span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">séracs</span></span>
        cover it nearly to the summit.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The snow was in very bad order, and as we sank at each
        step above the knee, it soon became evident that our prospects of
        success were extremely doubtful. A nearer approach, too, disclosed
        traces of fresh avalanches, and after much deliberation and a careful
        examination through the telescope, it was decided that the chances in
        our favour were too small to render it desirable to waste time in the
        attempt.... I examined the map, from which I perceived that the

        Faurio to the Ecrins) <span class="tei tei-q">“to the west, at a
        great depth below, must be that of La Bonne Pierre; and if a descent
        to its head was practicable, a passage might probably be effected to
        La Bérarde. On suggesting to Croz and Perrn that, though baffled by
        the state of the snow on the Ecrins, we might <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>still achieve something of interest and
        importance by discovering a new col, they both heartily assented, and
        in a few minutes Perrn was over the edge, and cutting his way down
        the rather formidable <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was the
        couloir at the foot of which we found ourselves at daybreak on the
        25th of June 1864; but before commencing the relation of our doings
        upon that eventful day, I must recount the experiences of Messrs.
        Mathews and Bonney in 1862.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These gentlemen,
        with the two Croz’s, attempted the ascent of the Ecrins a few weeks
        after Mr. Tuckett had inspected the mountain. On August 26, says Mr.
        Bonney, <span class="tei tei-q">“we pushed on, and our hopes each
        moment rose higher and higher; even the cautious Michel committed
        himself so far as to cry, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ah, malheureux
        Ecrins, vous serez bientôt morts,’</span> as we addressed ourselves
        to the last slope leading up to the foot of the final cone. The old
        proverb about <span class="tei tei-q">‘many a slip’</span> was,
        however, to prove true on this occasion. Arrived at the top of this
        slope, we found that we were cut off from the peak by a formidable
        bergschrund, crossed by the rottenest of snow-bridges. We looked to
        the right and to the left, to see whether it would be possible to get
        on either arête at its extremity; but instead of rising directly from
        the snow as they appeared to do from below, they were terminated by a
        wall of rock some forty feet high. There was but one place where the
        bergschrund was narrow enough to admit of crossing, and there a cliff
        of ice had to be climbed, and then a path to be cut up a steep slope
        of snow, before the arête could be reached. At last, after searching
        in vain for some time, Michel bade us wait a little, and started off
        to explore the gap separating the highest peak from the snow-dome on
        the right, and see if it were possible to ascend the rocky wall.
        Presently he appeared, evidently climbing with difficulty, and at
        last stood on the arête itself. Again we thought the victory was won,
        and started off to follow him. Suddenly he called to us to halt, and
        turned to descend. In a few minutes he <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>stopped. After a long pause he shouted to his
        brother, saying that he was not able to return by the way he had
        ascended. Jean was evidently uneasy about him, and for some time we
        watched him with much anxiety. At length he began to hew out steps in
        the snow along the face of the peak towards us. Jean now left us,
        and, making for the ice-cliff mentioned above, chopped away until,
        after about a quarter of an hour’s labour, he contrived, somehow or
        other, to worm himself up it, and began to cut steps to meet his
        brother. Almost every step appeared to be cut right through the snowy
        crust into the hard ice below, and an incipient stream of snow came
        hissing down the sides of the peak as they dug it away with their
        axes. Michel could not have been much more than 100 yards from us,
        and yet it was full three quarters of an hour before the brothers
        met. This done, they descended carefully, burying their axe-heads
        deep in the snow at every step.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Michel’s account was that he had reached the arête with
        great difficulty, and saw that it was practicable for some distance,
        in fact, as far as he could see; but that the snow was in a most
        dangerous condition, being very incoherent and resting on hard ice;
        that when he began to descend in order to tell us this, he found the
        rocks so smooth and slippery that return was impossible; and that for
        some little time he feared that he should not be able to extricate
        himself, and was in considerable danger. Of course the arête could
        have been reached by the way our guides had descended, but it was so
        evident that their judgment was against proceeding, that we did not
        feel justified in urging them on. We had seen so much of them that we
        felt sure they would never hang back unless there was real danger,
        and so we gave the word for retreating.”</span><a id="noteref_109"
        name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On both of these
        expeditions there was fine weather and plenty of time. On each
        occasion the parties slept out at, and started from, a considerable
        elevation, and arrived at the base of the final peak of the Ecrins
        early in the day, and with plenty of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>superfluous energy. Guides and travellers alike,
        on each occasion, were exceptional men, experienced mountaineers, who
        had proved their skill and courage on numerous antecedent occasions,
        and who were not accustomed to turn away from a thing merely because
        it was difficult. On each occasion the attempts were abandoned
        because the state of the snow on and below the final peak was such
        that avalanches were anticipated; and, according to the judgment of
        those who were concerned, there was such an amount of positive danger
        from this condition of things, that it was unjustifiable to
        persevere.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We learnt
        privately, from Messrs. Mathews, Bonney, and Tuckett, that unless the
        snow was in a good state upon the final peak (that is to say,
        coherent and stable), we should probably be of the same opinion as
        themselves; and that, although the face of the mountain fronting the
        Glacier de l’Encula was much less steep than its other faces, and was
        apparently the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">only</span></span> side upon which an attempt
        was at all likely to be successful, it was, nevertheless, so steep,
        that for several days, at least, after a fall of snow upon it, the
        chances in favour of avalanches would be considerable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader need
        scarcely be told, after all that has been said about the variableness
        of weather in the High Alps, the chance was small indeed that we
        should find upon the 25th of June, or any other set day, the precise
        condition of affairs that was deemed indispensable for success. We
        had such confidence in the judgment of our friends, that it was
        understood amongst us the ascent should be abandoned, unless the
        conditions were manifestly favourable.</p><a name="fig50" id="fig50"

        <div class="tei tei-figure" style="text-align: center"><img src=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By five minutes to
        six we were at the top of the gully (a first-rate couloir, about 1000
        feet high), and within sight of our work. Hard, thin, and wedge-like
        as the Ecrins had looked from afar, it had never looked so hard and
        so thin as it did when we emerged from the top of the couloir through
        the gap in the ridge. No tender shadows spoke of broad and rounded
        ridges, but sharp and shadowless its serrated edges stood out against
        the clear <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg
        155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class=

        "#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a> It had
        been said that the route must be taken by one of the ridges of the
        final peak, but both were alike repellent, hacked and notched in
        numberless places. They reminded me of my failure on the Dent
        d’Hérens in 1863, and of a place on a similar ridge, from which
        advance or retreat was alike difficult. But, presuming one or other
        of these ridges or arêtes was practicable, there remained the task of
        getting to them, for completely round the base of the final peak
        swept an enormous bergschrund, almost separating it from the slopes
        which lay beneath. It was evident thus early that the ascent would
        not be accomplished without exertion, and that it would demand all
        our faculties and all our time. In more than one respect we were
        favoured. The mists were gone, the day was bright and perfectly calm;
        there had been a long stretch of fine weather beforehand, and the
        snow was in excellent order; and, most important of all, the last new
        snow which had fallen on the final peak, unable to support itself,
        had broken away and rolled in a mighty avalanche, over schrund, névé,
        séracs, over hills and valleys in the glacier <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>(levelling one and filling the other),
        completely down to the summit of the Col des Ecrins, where it lay in
        huge jammed masses, powerless to harm us; and had made a broad track,
        almost a road, over which, for part of the way at least, we might
        advance with rapidity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We took in all
        this in a few minutes, and seeing there was no time to be lost,
        despatched a hasty meal, left knapsacks, provisions, and all
        incumbrances by the Col, started again at half-past six, and made
        direct for the left side of the schrund, for it was there alone that
        a passage was practicable. We crossed it at 8.10. Our route can now
        be followed upon the <a href="#fig51" class="tei tei-ref">annexed
        outline</a>. The arrow marked <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">D</span></span> points out the direction of the
        Glacier de la Bonne Pierre. The ridge in front, that extends right
        across, is the ridge that is partially shown on the top of the map at
        p. 146, leading from Roche Faurio towards the W.N.W. We arrived upon
        the plateau of the Glacier de l’Encula, behind this ridge, from the
        direction of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">D</span></span>, and then made a nearly straight
        track to the left hand of the bergschrund at <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">A</span></span>.</p><a name="fig51" id="fig51"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far there was
        no trouble, but the nature of the work changed immediately. If we
        regard the upper 700 feet alone of the final peak of the Ecrins, it
        may be described as a three-sided pyramid. One face is towards the
        Glacier Noir, and forms one of the sheerest precipices in the Alps.
        Another is towards the Glacier du Vallon, and is less steep, and less
        uniform in angle than the first. The third is towards the Glacier de
        l’Encula, and it was by this one we approached the summit. Imagine a
        triangular plane, 700 or 800 feet high, set at an angle exceeding
        50°; let it be smooth, glassy; let the uppermost edges be cut into
        spikes and teeth, and let them be bent, some one way, some another.
        Let the glassy face be covered with minute fragments of rock,
        scarcely attached, but varnished with ice; imagine this, and then
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157"
        id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>you will have a very faint idea
        of the face of the Ecrins on which we stood. It was not possible to
        avoid detaching stones, which, as they fell, cause words
        unmentionable to rise. The greatest friends would have reviled each
        other in such a situation. We gained the eastern arête, and
        endeavoured for half-an-hour to work upwards towards the summit; but
        it was useless (each yard of progress cost an incredible time); and
        having no desire to form the acquaintance of the Glacier Noir in a
        precipitate manner, we beat a retreat, and returned to the schrund.
        We again held a council, and it was unanimously decided that we
        should be beaten if we could not cut along the upper edge of the
        schrund, and, when nearly beneath the summit, work up to it. So Croz
        took off his coat and went to work;—on ice,—not that black ice so
        often mentioned and so seldom seen, but on ice as hard as ice could
        be. Weary work for the guides. Croz cut for more than half-an-hour,
        and we did not seem to have advanced at all. Some one behind, seeing
        how great the labour was, and how slow the progress, suggested that
        after all we might do better on the arête. Croz’s blood was up, and
        indignant at this slight on his powers, he ceased working, turned in
        his steps, and rushed towards me with a haste that made me shudder:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“By all means let us go there, the sooner the
        better.”</span> No slight was intended, and he resumed his work,
        after a time being relieved by Almer. Half-past ten came; an hour had
        passed; they were still cutting. Dreary work for us, for no capering
        about could be done here; hand as well as foot holes were necessary;
        the fingers and toes got very cold; the ice, as it boomed in bounding
        down the bergschrund, was very suggestive; conversation was very
        restricted, separated as we were by our tether of 20 feet apiece.
        Another hour passed. We were now almost immediately below the summit,
        and we stopped to look up. We were nearly as far off it (vertically)
        as we had been more than three hours before. The day seemed going
        against us. The only rocks near at hand were scattered; no bigger
        than tea-cups, and most of these, we found afterwards, were glazed
        with ice. Time forbade cutting right up to the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>summit, even had it been possible, which
        it was not. We decided to go up to the ridge again by means of the
        rocks; but had we not had a certain confidence in each other, it
        unquestionably would not have been done; for this, it must be
        understood, was a situation where not only <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">might</span></span> a
        slip have been fatal to every one, but it would have been so beyond
        doubt: nothing, moreover, was easier than to make one. It was a place
        where all had to work in unison, where there must be no slackening of
        the rope, and no unnecessary tension. For another hour we were in
        this trying situation, and at 12.30 we gained the arête again at a
        much higher point (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">B</span></span>), close to the summit. Our men
        were, I am afraid, well-nigh worn out. Cutting up a couloir 1000 feet
        high was not the right sort of preparation for work of this kind. Be
        it so or not, we were all glad to rest for a short time, for we had
        not sat down a minute since leaving the col six hours before. Almer,
        however, was restless, knowing that midday was past, and that much
        remained to be accomplished, and untied himself, and commenced
        working towards the summit. Connecting the teeth of rock were beds of
        snow, and Almer, only a few feet from me, was crossing the top of one
        of these, when suddenly, without a moment’s warning, it broke away
        under him, and plunged down on to the glacier. As he staggered for a
        second, one foot in the act of stepping, and the other on the falling
        mass, I thought him lost; but he happily fell on to the right side
        and stopped himself. Had he taken the step with his right instead of
        the left foot, he would, in all probability, have fallen several
        hundred feet without touching anything, and would not have been
        arrested before reaching the glacier, a vertical distance of at least
        3000 feet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Small,
        ridiculously small, as the distance was to the summit, we were
        occupied nearly another hour before it was gained. Almer was a few
        feet in front, and he, with characteristic modesty, hesitated to step
        on the highest point, and drew back to allow us to pass. A cry was
        raised for Croz, who had done the chief part of the work, but he
        declined the honour, and we marched on to the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>top simultaneously; that is to say,
        clustered round it, a yard or two below, for it was much too small to
        get upon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to my
        custom, I bagged a piece from off the highest rock (chlorite slate),
        and I found afterwards that it had a striking similarity to the final
        peak of the Ecrins. I have noticed the same thing on other
        occasions,<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href=
        "#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a> and it
        is worthy of remark that not only do fragments of such rock as
        limestone often present the characteristic forms of the cliffs from
        which they have been broken, but that morsels of mica slate will
        represent, in a wonderful manner, the identical shape of the peaks of
        which they have formed part. Why should it not be so if the
        mountain’s mass is more or less homogeneous? The same causes which
        produce the small forms fashion the large ones; the same influences
        are at work; the same frost and rain give shape to the mass as well
        as to its parts.</p><a name="fig52" id="fig52" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Did space permit
        me, I could give a very poor idea of the view, but it will be readily
        imagined that a panorama extending over as much ground as the whole
        of England is one worth taking some trouble to see, and one which is
        not often to be seen even in the Alps. No clouds obscured it, and a
        list of the summits that we saw would include nearly all the highest
        peaks of the chain. I saw the Pelvoux now—as I had seen the Ecrins
        from it three years before—across the basin of the Glacier Noir. It
        is a splendid mountain, although in height it is equalled, if not
        surpassed, by its neighbour the Aléfroide.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We could stay on
        the summit only a short time, and at a quarter to two prepared for
        the descent. Now, as we looked down, and thought of what we had
        passed over in coming up, we one and all hesitated about returning
        the same way. Moore said, no. Walker said the same, and I too; the
        guides were both of the same mind: this, be it remarked, although we
        had considered that there was no chance whatever of getting up any
        other way. But those <span class="tei tei-q">“last rocks”</span> were
        not to be forgotten. Had they only protruded to a moderate extent, or
        had they been merely glazed, we should doubtless still have tried:
        but they were not reasonable rocks,—they would neither allow us to
        hold, nor would do it themselves. So we turned to the western arête,
        trusting to luck that we should find a way down to the schrund, and
        some means of getting over it afterwards. Our faces were a tolerable
        index to our thoughts, and apparently the thoughts of the party were
        not happy ones. Had any one then said to me, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are a great fool for coming here,”</span> I should
        have answered with humility, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is too
        true.”</span> And had my monitor gone on to say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Swear you will never ascend another mountain if you get
        down safely,”</span> I am inclined to think I should have taken the
        oath. In fact, the game here was not worth the risk. The guides felt
        it as well as ourselves, and as Almer led off, he remarked, with more
        piety than logic, <span class="tei tei-q">“The good God has brought
        us up, and he will take us down in safety,”</span> which showed
        pretty well what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">he</span></span> was thinking about.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ridge down
        which we now endeavoured to make our way was not inferior in
        difficulty to the other. But were serrated to an extent that made it
        impossible to keep strictly to them, and obliged us to descend
        occasionally for some distance on the northern face and then mount
        again. Both were so rotten that the most experienced of our party, as
        well as the least, continually upset blocks large and small. Both
        arêtes were so narrow, so thin, that it was often a matter for
        speculation on which side an unstable block would fall.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At one point it
        seemed that we should be obliged to return to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the summit and try the other way down. We
        were on the very edge of the arête. On one side was the enormous
        precipice facing the Pelvoux, which is not far from perpendicular; on
        the other a slope exceeding 50°. A deep notch brought us to an abrupt
        halt. Almer, who was leading, advanced cautiously to the edge on
        hands and knees, and peered over; his care was by no means
        unnecessary, for the rocks had broken away from under us unexpectedly
        several times. In this position he gazed down for some moments, and
        then, without a word, turned his head and looked at us. His face
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">may</span></span> have expressed apprehension or
        alarm, but it certainly did not show hope or joy. We learned that
        there was no means of getting down, and that we must, if we wanted to
        pass the notch, jump across on to an unstable block on the other
        side. It was decided that it should be done, and Almer, with a larger
        extent of rope than usual, jumped. The rock swayed as he came down
        upon it, but he clutched a large mass with both arms and brought
        himself to anchor. That which was both difficult and dangerous for
        the first man was easy enough for the others, and we got across with
        less trouble than I expected; stimulated by Croz’s perfectly just
        observation, that if we couldn’t get across there we were not likely
        to get down the other way.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We had now arrived
        at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-weight: 700">C</span></span> and could no longer continue on
        the arête, so we commenced descending the face again. Before long we
        were close to the schrund, but unable to see what it was like at this
        part, as the upper edge bent over. Two hours had already passed since
        leaving the summit, and it began to be highly probable that we should
        have to spend a night on the Glacier Blanc. Almer, who yet led, cut
        steps right down to the edge, but still he could not see below;
        therefore, warning us to hold tight, he made his whole body rigid,
        and (standing in the large step which he had cut for the purpose),
        had the upper part of his person lowered out until he saw what he
        wanted. He shouted that our work was finished, made me come close to
        the edge and untie myself, advanced the others until he had rope
        enough, and then with a loud <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">jödel</span></span> jumped <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>down on to soft snow. Partly by skill and
        partly by luck he had hit the crevasse at its easiest point, and we
        had only to make a downward jump of eight or ten feet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We had been more
        than eight hours and a half accomplishing the ascent of the final
        peak, which, according to an observation by Mr. Bonney in 1862, is
        only 525 feet high.<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href=
        "#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a> During
        this period we had not stopped for more than half-an-hour, and our
        nerves and muscles had been kept at the highest degree of tension the
        whole time. It may be imagined that we accepted the ordinary
        conditions of glacier travelling as an agreeable relief, and that
        that which at another time might have seemed formidable we treated as
        the veriest bagatelle. Late in the day as it was, and soft as was the
        snow, we put on such pace that we reached the Col des Ecrins in less
        than forty minutes. We lost no time in arranging our baggage, for we
        had still to traverse a long glacier, and to get clear of two
        ice-falls before it was dark; so, at 5.35 we resumed the march,
        adjourning eating and drinking, and put on a spurt which took us
        clear of the Glacier Blanc by 7.45 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span><a id=
        "noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> We got
        off the moraine of the Glacier Noir at 8.45, just as the last remnant
        of daylight vanished. Croz and myself were a trifle in advance of the
        others, and fortunately so for us; for as they were about to commence
        the descent of the snout of the glacier, the whole of the moraine
        that rested on its face peeled off, and came down with a tremendous
        roar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We had now the
        pleasure of walking over a plain that is known by the name of the Pré
        de Madame Carle, covered with pebbles of all sizes, and intersected
        by numerous small streams or torrents. Every hole looked like a
        stone, every stone like a hole, and we tumbled about from side to
        side until our limbs and our tempers became thoroughly jaded. My
        companions, being both short-sighted, found the travelling especially
        disagreeable; so <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg
        163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>there was little wonder that when we came upon a
        huge mass of rock as big as a house, which had fallen from the flanks
        of Pelvoux, a regular cube that offered no shelter whatever, Moore
        cried out in ecstasy, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, how delightful!
        the very thing I have been longing for. Let us have a perfectly
        extemporaneous bivouac.”</span> This, it should be said, was when the
        night threatened thunder and lightning, rain, and all other
        delights.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pleasures of a
        perfectly extemporaneous bivouac under these circumstances not being
        novelties to Croz and myself, we thought we would try for the
        miseries of a roof; but Walker and Almer, with their usual good
        nature, declared it was the very thing that they, too, were longing
        for; so the trio resolved to stop. We generously left them all the
        provisions (a dozen cubic inches or thereabouts of bacon fat, and
        half a candle), and pushed on for the chalets of Aléfroide, or at
        least we thought we did, but could not be certain. In the course of
        half-an-hour we got uncommonly close to the main torrent, and Croz
        all at once disappeared. I stepped cautiously forward to peer down
        into the place where I thought he was, and quietly tumbled head over
        heels into a big rhododendron bush. Extricating myself with some
        trouble, I fell backwards over some rocks, and got wedged in a cleft
        so close to the torrent that it splashed all over me.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The colloquy which
        then ensued amid the thundering of the stream was as follows:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hullo, Croz!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Eh,
        Monsieur.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Where <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></span>
        you?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Here, Monsieur.”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Where <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">is</span></span> here?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don’t know; where are <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">you</span></span>?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Here, Croz;”</span> and so on.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact was, from
        the intense darkness, and the noise of the torrent, we had no idea of
        each other’s situation. In the course of ten minutes, however, we
        joined together again, agreed we had had quite enough of that kind of
        thing, and adjourned to a most eligible rock at 10.15.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How well I
        remember the night at that rock, and the jolly way in which Croz came
        out! We were both very wet about the legs, <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>and both uncommonly hungry, but the time passed
        pleasantly enough round our fire of juniper, and until long past
        midnight we sat up recounting, over our pipes, wonderful stories of
        the most incredible description, in which I must admit, my companion
        beat me hollow. Then throwing ourselves on our beds of rhododendron,
        we slept an untroubled sleep, and rose on a bright Sunday morning as
        fresh as might be, intending to enjoy a day’s rest and luxury with
        our friends at La Ville de Val Louise.</p><a name="fig53" id="fig53"

        give the impression I wish if it has not been made evident that the
        ascent of the Pointe des Ecrins was not an ordinary piece of work.
        There is an increasing disposition now-a-days amongst those who write
        on the Alps, to underrate the difficulties and dangers which are met
        with, and this disposition is, I think, not less mischievous than the
        old-fashioned style of making everything terrible. Difficult as we
        found the peak, I believe we <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>took it at the best, perhaps the only possible,
        time of the year. The great slope on which we spent so much time was,
        from being denuded by the avalanche of which I have spoken, deprived
        of its greatest danger. Had it had the snow still resting upon it,
        and had we persevered with the expedition, we should almost without
        doubt have ended with calamity instead of success. The ice of that
        slope is always below, its angle is severe, and the rocks do not
        project sufficiently to afford the support that snow requires, to be
        stable, when at a great angle. So far am I from desiring to tempt any
        one to repeat the expedition, that I put it on record as my belief,
        however sad and however miserable a man may have been, if he is found
        on the summit of the Pointe des Ecrins after a fall of new snow, he
        is likely to experience misery far deeper than anything with which he
        has hitherto been acquainted.<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again we were
        received with the most cordial hospitality. Everything that was
        eatable or drinkable was brought out and pressed upon us; every
        little curiosity was exhibited; every information that could be
        afforded was given; and when we retired to our clean straw, we again
        congratulated each other that we had escaped from the foul den which
        is where a good inn should be, and had cast in our lot with those who
        dwell in chalets. Very luxurious that straw seemed after two nights
        upon quartz pebbles and glacier mud, and I felt quite aggrieved
        (expecting it was the summons for departure) when, about midnight,
        the heavy wooden door creaked on its hinges, and a man hem’d and ha’d
        to attract attention; but when it whispered, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Monsieur Edvard,”</span> I perceived my mistake,—it was
        our Pelvoux companion, Monsieur Reynaud, the excellent <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">agent-voyer</span></span> of La Bessée.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Monsieur Reynaud
        had been invited to accompany us on the excursion that is described
        in this chapter, but had arrived at Val Louise after we had left, and
        had energetically pursued us during the night. Our idea was that a
        pass might be made over the high ridge called (on the French map)
        Crête de Bœufs Rouges,<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href=
        "#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a> near to
        the peak named Les Bans, and that it might be the shortest route in
        time (as it certainly would be in distance) from Val Louise, across
        the Central Dauphiné Alps. We had seen the northern (or Pilatte) side
        from the Brèche de la Meije, and it seemed to be practicable at one
        place near the above-mentioned mountain. More than that could not be
        told at a distance of eleven miles. We intended to try to hit a point
        on the ridge immediately above the part where it seemed to be
        easiest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We left Entraigues
        at 3.30 on the morning of June 27, and proceeded, over very
        gently-inclined ground, towards the foot of <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the Pic de Bonvoisin (following in fact the
        route of the Col de Sellar, which leads from the Val Louise into the
        Val Godemar);<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href=
        "#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        5 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span>, finding that there was no chance
        of obtaining a view from the bottom of the valley of the ridge over
        which our route was to be taken, sent Almer up the lower slopes of
        the Bonvoisin to reconnoitre. He telegraphed that we might proceed;
        and at 5.45 we quitted the snow-beds at the bottom of the valley for
        the slopes which rose towards the north.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The course was
        N.N.W., and was prodigiously steep. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In less than two miles
        difference of latitude we rose one mile of absolute
        height.</span></span> But the route was so far from being an
        exceptionally difficult one, that at 10.45 we stood on the summit of
        the pass, having made an ascent of more than 5000 feet in five hours,
        inclusive of halts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon sheet 189 of
        the French map a glacier is laid down on the south of the Crête des
        Bœufs Rouges, extending along the entire length of the ridge, at its
        foot, from east to west. In 1864 this glacier did not exist as
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">one</span></span> glacier, but in the place
        where it should have been there were several small ones, all of which
        were, I believe, separated from each other.<a id="noteref_120" name=
        "noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We commenced the
        ascent from the Val d’Entraigues, to the west of the most western of
        these small glaciers, and quitted the valley by the first great gap
        in its cliffs after that glacier was passed. We did not take to the
        ice until it afforded an easier route than the rocks; then (8.30)
        Croz went to the front, and led with admirable skill through a maze
        of crevasses up to the foot of a great snow <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">couloir</span></span>,
        that rose from the head of the glacier to the summit of the ridge
        over which we had to pass.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We had settled
        beforehand in London, without knowing any<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        couloir as this should be in this angle; but when we got into the Val
        d’Entraigues, and found that it was not possible to see into the
        corner, our faith in its existence became less and less, until the
        telegraphing of Almer, who was sent up the opposite slopes to search
        for it, assured us that we were true prophets.</p><a name="fig54" id=

        are nothing more or less than gullies partly filled by snow. They are
        most useful institutions, and may be considered as natural highways
        placed, by a kind Providence, in convenient situations for getting
        over places which would otherwise be inac<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>cessible. They are a joy to the mountaineer,
        and, from afar, assure him of a path when all beside is uncertain;
        but they are grief to novices, who, when upon steep snow, are usually
        seized with two notions—first, that the snow will slip, and secondly,
        that those who are upon it must slip too.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing, perhaps,
        could look much more unpromising to those who do not know the virtues
        of couloirs than such a place as the <a href="#fig54" class=
        "tei tei-ref">engraving</a> represents,<a id="noteref_121" name=
        "noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a> and if
        persons inexperienced in mountain craft had occasion to cross a ridge
        or to climb rocks, in which there were such couloirs, they would
        instinctively avoid them. But practised mountaineers would naturally
        look to them for a path, and would follow them almost as a matter of
        course, unless they turned out to be filled with ice, or too much
        swept by falling stones, or the rock at the sides proved to be of
        such an exceptional character as to afford an easier path than the
        snow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Couloirs look
        prodigiously steep when seen from the front, and, so viewed, it is
        impossible to be certain of their inclination within many degrees.
        Snow, however, does actually lie at steeper angles in couloirs than
        in any other situations;—45° to 50° degrees is not an uncommon
        inclination. Even at such angles, two men with proper axes can mount
        on snow at the rate of 700 to 800 feet per hour. The same amount can
        only be accomplished in the same time on steep rocks when they are of
        the very easiest character, and four or five hours may be readily
        spent upon an equal height of difficult rocks. Snow couloirs are
        therefore to be commended because they economise time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course, in all
        gullies, one is liable to be encountered by falling stones. Most of
        those which fall from the rocks of a couloir, sooner or later spin
        down the snow which fills the trough; and, as their course and pace
        are more clearly apparent when falling over snow than when jumping
        from ledge to ledge, persons with lively <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>imaginations are readily impressed by them. The
        grooves which are usually seen wandering down the length of snow
        couloirs are deepened (and, perhaps, occasionally originated) by
        falling stones, and they are sometimes pointed out by cautious men as
        reasons why couloirs should not be followed. I think they are very
        frequently only gutters, caused by water trickling off the rocks.
        Whether this is so or not, one should always consider the possibility
        of being struck by falling stones, and, in order to lessen the risk
        as far as possible, should mount upon the sides of the snow, and not
        up its centre. Stones that come off the rocks will then generally fly
        over one’s head, or bound down the middle of the trough at a safe
        distance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At 9.30
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> we commenced the ascent of the
        couloir leading from the nameless glacier to a point in the ridge,
        just to the east of Mont Bans.<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122"
        href="#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a> So far
        the route had been nothing more than a steep grind in an angle where
        little could be seen, but now views opened out in several directions,
        and the way began to be interesting. It was more so, perhaps, to us
        than to our companion M. Reynaud, who had no rest in the last night.
        He was, moreover, heavily laden. Science was to be regarded—his
        pockets were stuffed with books; heights and angles were to be
        observed—his knapsack was filled with instruments; hunger was to be
        guarded against—his shoulders were ornamented with a huge nimbus of
        bread, and a leg of mutton swung behind from his knapsack, looking
        like an overgrown tail. Being a good-hearted fellow, he had brought
        this food, thinking we might be in need of it. As it happened, we
        were well provided for, and having our own packs to carry, could not
        relieve him of his superfluous burdens, which, naturally, he did not
        like to throw away. As the angles steepened, the strain on his
        strength became more and more apparent. At last he began to groan. At
        first a most gentle and mellow groan; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>but as we rose so did his groans, till at last
        the cliffs were groaning in echo, and we were moved to laughter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Croz cut the way
        with unflagging energy throughout the whole of the ascent, and at
        10.45 we stood on the summit of our pass, intending to refresh
        ourselves with a good halt. Unhappily, at that moment a mist, which
        had been playing about the ridge, swooped down and blotted out the
        whole of the view on the northern side. Croz was the only one who
        caught a glimpse of the descent, and it was deemed advisable to push
        on immediately, while its recollection was fresh in his memory. We
        are consequently unable to tell anything about the summit of the
        pass, except that it lies immediately to the east of Mont Bans, and
        is elevated about 11,300 feet above the level of the sea. It is the
        highest pass in Dauphiné. We called it the Col de Pilatte.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We commenced to
        descend towards the Glacier de Pilatte by a slope of smooth ice, the
        face of which, according to the measurement of Mr. Moore, had an
        inclination of 54°! Croz still led, and the others followed at
        intervals of about 15 feet, all being tied together, and Almer
        occupying the responsible position of last man. The two guides were
        therefore about 70 feet apart. They were quite invisible to each
        other from the mist, and looked spectral even to us. But the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">strong</span></span> man could be heard by all
        hewing out the steps below, while every now and then the voice of the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">steady</span></span> man pierced the
        cloud,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Slip not, dear sirs; place well your
        feet: stir not until you are certain.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For three quarters
        of an hour we progressed in this fashion. The axe of Croz all at once
        stopped. <span class="tei tei-q">“What is the matter, Croz?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Bergschrund, gentlemen.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Can we get over?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Upon
        my word, I don’t know; I think we must jump.”</span> The clouds
        rolled away right and left as he spoke. The effect was dramatic! It
        was a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">coup
        de théâtre</span></span>, preparatory to the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“great sensation leap”</span> which was about to be
        executed by the entire company.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some unseen cause,
        some cliff or obstruction in the rocks underneath, had caused our
        wall of ice to split into two portions, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>and the huge fissure which had thus been formed
        extended, on each hand, as far as could be seen. We, on the slope
        above, were separated from the slope below by a mighty crevasse. No
        running up and down to look for an easier place to cross could be
        done on an ice-slope of 54°; the chasm had to be passed then and
        there.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A downward jump of
        15 or 16 feet, and a forward leap of 7 or 8 feet had to be made at
        the same time. That is not much, you will say. It was not much; it
        was not the quantity, but it was the quality of the jump which gave
        to it its particular flavour. You had to hit a narrow ridge of ice.
        If that was passed, it seemed as if you might roll down for ever and
        ever. If it was not attained, you dropped into the crevasse below;
        which, although partly choked by icicles and snow that had fallen
        from above, was still gaping in many places, ready to receive an
        erratic body.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Croz untied Walker
        in order to get rope enough, and warning us to hold fast, sprang over
        the chasm. He alighted cleverly on his feet; untied himself and sent
        up the rope to Walker, who followed his example. It was then my turn,
        and I advanced to the edge of the ice. The second which followed was
        what is called a supreme moment. That is to say, I felt supremely
        ridiculous. The world seemed to revolve at a frightful pace, and my
        stomach to fly away. The next moment I found myself sprawling in the
        snow, and then, of course, vowed that <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">it was
        nothing</span></span>, and prepared to encourage my friend
        Reynaud.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He came to the
        edge and made declarations. I do not believe that he was a whit more
        reluctant to pass the place than we others, but he was infinitely
        more demonstrative,—in a word, he was French. He wrung his hands,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh! what a <span class=

        such a thing in an ice-step, and covered his face with his hands,
        ejaculating, <span class="tei tei-q">“Upon my word, it is not
        possible. No! no!! no!!! it is not possible.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How he came over I
        do not know. We saw a toe—it seemed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>to belong to Moore; we saw Reynaud a flying
        body, coming down as if taking a header into water; with arms and
        legs all abroad, his leg of mutton flying in the air, his bâton
        escaped from his grasp; and then we heard a thud as if a bundle of
        carpets had been pitched out of a window. When set upon his feet he
        was a sorry spectacle; his head was a great snowball; brandy was
        trickling out of one side of the knapsack, chartreuse out of the
        other—we bemoaned its loss, but we roared with laughter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This chapter has
        already passed the limits within which it should have been confined,
        but I cannot close it without paying tribute to the ability with
        which Croz led us, through a dense mist, down the remainder of the
        Glacier de Pilatte. As an exhibition of strength and skill, it has
        probably never been surpassed in the Alps or elsewhere. On this
        almost unknown and very steep glacier, he was perfectly at home, even
        in the mists. Never able to see fifty feet ahead, he still went on
        with the utmost certainty, and without having to retrace a single
        step; and displayed from first to last consummate knowledge of the
        materials with which he was dealing. Now he cut steps down one side
        of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sérac</span></span>, went with a dash at the
        other side, and hauled us up after him; then cut away along a ridge
        until a point was gained from which we could jump on to another
        ridge; then, doubling back, found a snow-bridge, across which he
        crawled on hands and knees, towed us across by the legs, ridiculing
        our apprehensions, mimicking our awkwardness, declining all help,
        bidding us only to follow him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About 1
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> we emerged from the mist and
        found ourselves just arrived upon the level portion of the glacier,
        having, as Reynaud properly remarked, come down as quickly as if
        there had not been any mist at all. Then we attacked the leg of
        mutton which my friend had so thoughtfully brought with him, and
        afterwards raced down, with renewed energy, to La Bérarde.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reynaud and I
        walked together to St. Christophe, where we parted. Since then we
        have talked over the doings of this <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>momentous day; and I know that he would not, for
        a good deal, have missed the passage of the Col de Pilatte, although
        we failed to make it an easier or a shorter route than the Col du
        Selé. I rejoined Moore and Walker, the same evening, at Venos, and on
        the next day went with them over the Lautaret road to the hospice on
        its summit, where we slept.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So our little
        campaign in Dauphiné came to an end. It was remarkable for the
        absence of failures, and for the ease and precision with which all
        our plans were carried out. This was due very much to the spirit of
        my companions; but it was also owing to the fine weather which we
        were fortunate enough to enjoy, and to our making a very early start
        every morning. By beginning our work at or before the break of day,
        on the longest days in the year, we were not only able to avoid
        hurrying when deliberation was desirable, but could afford to spend
        several hours in delightful ease whenever the fancy seized us.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot too
        strongly recommend to tourists in search of amusement to avoid the
        inns of Dauphiné. Sleep in the chalets. Get what food you can from
        the inns, but do not as a rule attempt to pass nights in them.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few years ago
        not many persons knew from personal knowledge how extremely
        inaccurately the chain of Mont Blanc was delineated. In the earlier
        part of the century thousands had made the tour of the chain, and
        before the year 1860 at least <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">one</span></span> thousand individuals had stood
        upon its highest summit; but out of all this number there was not one
        capable, willing, or able, to map the mountain which, until recently,
        was regarded the highest in Europe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many persons knew
        that great blunders had been perpetrated, and it was notorious that
        even Mont Blanc itself was represented in a ludicrously incorrect
        manner on all sides excepting the north; but there was not, perhaps,
        a single individual who knew, at the time to which I refer, that
        errors of no less than 1000 feet had been committed in the
        determination of heights at each end of the chain; that some glaciers
        were represented of double their real dimensions; and that ridges and
        mountains were laid down which actually had no existence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One portion alone
        of the entire chain had been surveyed at the time of which I speak
        with anything like accuracy. It was not done (as one would have
        expected) by a Government, but by a private individual,—by the
        British De Saussure,—the late J. D. Forbes. In the year 1842, he
        <span class="tei tei-q">“made a special survey of the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Mer de Glace of Chamounix and its
        tributaries, which, in some of the following years, he extended by
        further observations, so as to include the Glacier des
        Bossons.”</span> The map produced from this survey was worthy of its
        author; and subsequent explorers of the region he investigated have
        been able to detect only trivial inaccuracies in his work.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1861, Sheet
        xxii. of Dufour’s Map of Switzerland appeared. It included the
        section of the chain of Mont Blanc that belonged to Switzerland, and
        this portion of the sheet was executed with the admirable fidelity
        and thoroughness which characterise the whole of Dufour’s unique map.
        The remainder of the chain (amounting to about four-fifths of the
        whole) was laid down after the work of previous topographers, and its
        wretchedness was made more apparent by contrast with the finished
        work of the Swiss surveyors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1863, Mr.
        Adams-Reilly, who had been travelling in the Alps during several
        years, resolved to attempt a survey of the unsurveyed portions of the
        chain of Mont Blanc. He provided himself with a good theodolite, and
        starting from a base-line measured by Forbes in the Valley of
        Chamounix, determined the positions of no less than 200 points. The
        accuracy of his work may be judged from the fact that, after having
        turned many corners and carried his observations over a distance of
        fifty miles, his Col Ferret <span class="tei tei-q">“fell within 200
        yards of the position assigned to it by General Dufour!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the winter of
        1863 and the spring of 1864, Mr. Reilly constructed an entirely
        original map from his newly-acquired data. The spaces between his
        trigonometrically determined points he filled in after photographs,
        and a series of panoramic sketches which he made from his different
        stations. The map so produced was an immense advance upon those
        already in existence, and it was the first which exhibited the great
        peaks in their proper positions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This extraordinary
        piece of work revealed Mr. Reilly to me as a man of wonderful
        determination and perseverance. With very small hope that my proposal
        would be accepted, I invited him to take part in renewed attacks on
        the Matterhorn. He entered <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg
        178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>heartily into my plans, and met me with a
        counter-proposition, namely, that I should accompany him on some
        expeditions which he had projected in the chain of Mont Blanc. The
        unwritten contract took this form:—I will help you to carry out your
        desires, and you shall assist me to carry out mine. I eagerly closed
        with an arrangement in which all the advantages were upon my
        side.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the time that
        Mr. Reilly was carrying on his survey, Captain Mieulet was executing
        another in continuation of the great map of France; for about
        one-half of the chain of Mont Blanc (including the whole of the
        valley of Chamounix) had recently become French once more. Captain
        Mieulet was directed to survey up to his frontier only, and the sheet
        which was destined to include his work was to be engraved, of course,
        upon the scale of the rest of the map, viz., 1/80000 of nature. But
        upon representations being made at head-quarters that it would be of
        great advantage to extend the survey as far as <a name="corr178" id=
        "corr178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
        "tei tei-corr">Courmayeur</span>, Captain Mieulet was directed to
        continue his observations into the south (or Italian) side of the
        chain. A special sheet on the scale of 1/40000 was promptly engraved
        from the materials he accumulated, and was published in 1865, by
        order of the late Minister of War, Marshal Randon.<a id="noteref_124"
        name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> This
        sheet was admirably executed, but it included the central portion of
        the chain only, and a complete map was still wanting.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Reilly
        presented his MS. map to the English Alpine Club. It was resolved
        that it should be published; but before it passed into the engraver’s
        hands its author undertook to revise it carefully. To this end he
        planned a number of expeditions to high points which up to that time
        had been regarded inaccessible, and upon some of these ascents he
        invited me to accompany him. Before I pass on to these expeditions,
        it will be convenient to devote a few lines to the topography of the
        chain of Mont Blanc.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the present
        time the chain is divided betwixt France, Switzerland, and Italy.
        France has the lion’s share, Switzerland <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the most fertile portion, and Italy the steepest
        side. It has acquired a reputation which is not extraordinary, but
        which is not wholly merited. It has neither the beauty of the
        Oberland, nor the sublimity of Dauphiné. It attracts the vulgar by
        the possession of the highest summit in the Alps. If that is removed,
        the elevation of the chain is in nowise remarkable. In fact,
        excluding Mont Blanc itself, the mountains of which the chain is made
        up are less important than those of the Oberland and the central
        Pennine groups. The following table will afford a ready means of
        comparison.<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The frontier-line
        follows the main ridge. Very little of it can be seen from the Valley
        of Chamounix, and from the village itself two small strips only are
        visible (amounting to scarcely three miles <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>in length)—viz. from the summit of Mont Blanc to
        the Dôme du Goûter, and in the neighbourhood of the Col de Balme. All
        the rest is concealed by outlying ridges and by mountains of
        secondary importance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mont Blanc itself
        is bounded by the two glaciers of Miage, the glaciers de la Brenva
        and du Géant, the Val Véni and the Valley of Chamounix. A long ridge
        runs out towards the N.N.E. from the summit, through Mont Maudit, to
        the Aiguille du Midi. Another ridge proceeds towards the N.W.,
        through the Bosse du Dromadaire to the Dôme du Goûter; this then
        divides into two, of which one continues N.W. to the Aiguille du
        Goûter, and the other (which is a part of the main ridge of the
        chain) towards the W. to the Aiguille de Bionnassay. The two routes
        which are commonly followed for the ascent of Mont Blanc lie between
        these two principal ridges—one leading from Chamounix, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viâ</span></span> the
        Grands Mulets, the other from the village of Bionnassay, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viâ</span></span> the
        Aiguille and Dôme du Goûter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ascent of Mont
        Blanc has been made from several directions besides these, and
        perhaps there is no single point of the compass from which the
        mountain cannot be ascended. But there is not the least probability
        that any one will discover easier ways to the summit than those
        already known.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I believe it is
        correct to say that the Aiguille du Midi and the Aiguille de Miage
        were the only two summits in the chain of Mont Blanc which had been
        ascended at the beginning of 1864.<a id="noteref_127" name=
        "noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a> The
        latter of these two is a perfectly insignificant point; and the
        former is only a portion of one of the ridges just now mentioned, and
        can hardly be regarded as a mountain separate and distinct from Mont
        Blanc. The really great peaks of the chain were considered
        inaccessible, and, I think, with the exception of the Aiguille Verte,
        had never been assailed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The finest, as
        well as the highest peak in the chain (after Mont Blanc itself), is
        the Grandes Jorasses. The next, without a <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>doubt, is the Aiguille Verte. The Aiguille de
        Bionnassay, which in actual height follows the Verte, should be
        considered as a part of Mont Blanc; and in the same way the summit
        called Les Droites is only a part of the ridge which culminates in
        the Verte. The Aiguille de Trélatête is the next on the list that is
        entitled to be considered a separate mountain, and is by far the most
        important peak (as well as the highest) at the south-west end of the
        chain. Then comes the Aiguille d’Argentière, which occupies the same
        rank at the north-east end as the last-mentioned mountain does in the
        south-west. The rest of the aiguilles are comparatively
        insignificant; and although some of them (such as the Mont Dolent)
        look well from low elevations, and seem to possess a certain
        importance, they sink into their proper places directly one arrives
        at a considerable altitude.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The summit of the
        Aiguille Verte would have been one of the best stations out of all
        these mountains for the purposes of my friend. Its great height, and
        its isolated and commanding position, make it a most admirable point
        for viewing the intricacies of the chain; but he exercised a wise
        discretion in passing it by, and in selecting as our first excursion
        the passage of the Col de Triolet.<a id="noteref_128" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We slept under
        some big rocks on the Couvercle on the night of July 7, with the
        thermometer at 26·5 Faht., and at 4.30 on the 8th made a straight
        track to the north of the Jardin, and thence went in zigzags, to
        break the ascent, over the upper slopes of the Glacier de Talèfre
        towards the foot of the Aiguille de Triolet. Croz was still my guide,
        Reilly was accompanied by one of the Michel Payots of Chamounix, and
        Henri Charlet, of the same place, was our porter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The way was over
        an undulating plain of glacier of moderate inclination until the
        corner leading to the Col, from whence a steep secondary glacier led
        down into the basin of the Talèfre. We experienced no difficulty in
        making the ascent of this secondary <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        at 7.50 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        so-called pass, at a height, according to Mieulet, of 12,162 feet,
        and 4530 above our camp on the Couvercle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The descent was
        commenced by very steep, but firm, rocks, and then by a branch of the
        Glacier de Triolet. Schrunds<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129"

        abundant; there were no less than five extending completely across
        the glacier, all of which had to be jumped. Not one was equal in
        dimensions to the extraordinary chasm on the Col de Pilatte, although
        in the aggregate they far surpassed it. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our
        lives,”</span> so Reilly expressed it, <span class="tei tei-q">“were
        made a burden to us with schrunds.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We flattered
        ourselves that we should arrive at the chalets of Prè du Bar very
        early in the day; but, owing to much time being lost on the slopes of
        Mont Rouge, it was nearly 4 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> before we got to them. There were
        no bridges across the torrent nearer than Gruetta, and rather than
        descend so far, we preferred to round the base of Mont Rouge, and to
        cross the snout of the Glacier du Mont Dolent.<a id="noteref_130"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We occupied the
        9th with a scramble up Mont Dolent. This was a miniature ascent. It
        contained a little of everything. First we went up to the Col Ferret
        (No. 1), and had a little grind over shaly banks; then there was a
        little walk over grass; then a little tramp over a moraine (which,
        strange to say, gave a pleasant path); then a little zigzagging over
        the snow-covered glacier of Mont Dolent. Then there was a little
        bergschrund; then a little wall of snow,—which we mounted by the side
        of a little buttress; and when we struck the ridge descending S.E.
        from the summit, we found a little arête of snow leading to the
        highest point. The summit itself was little,—very small indeed; it
        was the loveliest little cone of snow that was ever piled up on
        mountain-top; so <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg
        183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>soft, so pure; it seemed a crime to defile it;
        it was a miniature Jungfrau, a toy summit, you could cover it with
        the hand.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href=
        "#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there was
        nothing little about the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">view</span></span> from the Mont Dolent.
        [Situated at the junction of three mountain ridges, it rises in a
        positive steeple far above anything in its immediate neighbourhood;
        and certain gaps in the surrounding ridges, which seem contrived for
        that especial purpose, extend the view in almost every direction. The
        precipices which descend to the Glacier d’Argentière I can only
        compare to those of the Jungfrau, and the ridges on both sides of
        that glacier, especially the steep rocks of Les Droites and Les
        Courtes, surmounted by the sharp snow-peak of the Aig. Verte, have
        almost the effect of the Grandes Jorasses. Then, framed, as it were,
        between the massive tower of the Aig. de Triolet and the more distant
        Jorasses, lies, without exception, the most delicately beautiful
        picture I have ever seen—the whole <span class=

        Mont Blanc, raising its great head of snow far above the tangled
        series of flying buttresses which uphold the Monts Maudits, supported
        on the left by Mont Peuteret and by the mass of ragged aiguilles
        which overhang the Brenva. This aspect of Mont Blanc is not new, but
        from this point its <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        the superiority of a picture grouped by the hand of a master.... The

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We went down to
        Courmayeur, and on the afternoon of July 10 started from that place
        to camp on Mont Suc, for the ascent of the Aiguille de Trélatête;
        hopeful that the mists which were hanging about would clear away.
        They did not, so we deposited ourselves, and a vast load of straw, on
        the moraine of the Miage Glacier, just above the Lac de Combal, in a
        charming little hole which some solitary shepherd had excavated
        beneath a great slab of rock. We spent the night there, and the whole
        of the next day, unwilling <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg
        184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
        run away, and equally so to get into difficulties by venturing into
        the mist. It was a dull time, and I grew restless. Reilly read to me
        a lecture on the excellence of patience, and composed himself in an
        easy attitude, to pore over the pages of a yellow-covered book.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Patience,”</span> I said to him viciously,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“comes readily to fellows who have shilling
        novels; but I have not got one; I have picked all the mud out of the
        nails of my boots, and have skinned my face; what shall I do?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Go and study the moraine of the
        Miage,”</span> said he. I went, and came back after an hour.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What news?”</span> cried Reilly, raising
        himself on his elbow. <span class="tei tei-q">“Very little; it’s a
        big moraine, bigger than I thought, with ridge outside ridge, like a
        fortified camp; and there are walls upon it which have been built and
        loop-holed, as if for defence.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Try
        again,”</span> he said, as he threw himself on his back. But I went
        to Croz, who was asleep, and tickled his nose with a straw until he
        awoke; and then, as that amusement was played out, watched Reilly,
        who was getting numbed, and shifted uneasily from side to side, and
        threw himself on his stomach, and rested his head on his elbows, and
        lighted his pipe and puffed at it savagely. When I looked again, how
        was Reilly? An indistinguishable heap; arms, legs, head, stones, and
        straw, all mixed together, his hat flung on one side, his novel
        tossed far away! Then I went to him, and read him a lecture on the
        excellence of patience.</p><a name="fig55" id="fig55" class=

        and we stole up on tiptoe through the grand portal formed by Mont
        Suc. But night advanced rapidly, and we found ourselves left out in
        the cold, without a hole to creep into or shelter from overhanging
        rock. We might have fared badly, except for our good plaids. When
        they were sewn together down their long edges, and one end tossed
        over our rope (which was passed round some rocks), and the other
        secured by stones, there was sufficient protection; and we slept on

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We left our
        bivouac at 4.45 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span>, and at 9.40 arrived upon the
        highest of the three summits of the Trélatête, by passing over the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186"
        id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lowest one. It was well above
        everything at this end of the chain, and the view from it was
        extraordinarily magnificent. The whole of the western face of Mont
        Blanc was spread out before us; we were the first by whom it had been
        ever seen. I cede the description of this view to my comrade, to whom
        it rightfully belongs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">[For four years I
        had felt great interest in the geography of the chain; the year
        before I had mapped, more or less successfully, all but this spot,
        and this spot had always eluded my grasp. The praises, undeserved as
        they were, which my map had received, were as gall and wormwood to me
        when I thought of that great slope which I had been obliged to leave
        a blank, speckled over with unmeaning dots of rock, gathered from
        previous maps—for I had consulted them all without meeting an
        intelligible representation of it. From the surface of the Miage
        glacier I had gained nothing, for I could only see the feet of
        magnificent ice-streams, and no more; but now, from the top of the
        dead wall of rock which had so long closed my view, I saw those fine
        glaciers from top to bottom, pouring down their streams, nearly as
        large as the Bossons, from Mont Blanc, from the Bosse, and from the
        Dôme.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The head of Mont
        Blanc is supported on this side by two buttresses, between which vast
        glaciers descend. Of these the most southern<a id="noteref_134" name=

        its rise at the foot of the precipices which fall steeply down from

        "#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        stream, as it joins that of the Miage, is cut in two by an enormous
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">rognon</span></span> of rock. Next, to the left,
        comes the largest of the buttresses of which I have spoken, almost
        forming an aiguille in itself. The next glacier<a id="noteref_136"
        name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a>
        descends from a large basin which receives the snows of the
        summit-ridge between the Bosse and the Dome, and it is divided from
        the third and last glacier<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137"
        href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> by
        another buttress, which joins the summit-ridge at a point between the
        Dôme and the Aig. de Bionnassay.]</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great
        buttresses betwixt these magnificent ice-streams have <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>supplied a large portion of the enormous
        masses of débris which are disposed in ridges round about, and are
        strewn over, the termination of the Glacier de Miage in the Val Véni.
        These moraines<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href=
        "#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> used to
        be classed amongst the wonders of the world. They are very large for
        a glacier of the size of the Miage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dimensions of
        moraines are not ruled by those of glaciers. Many small glaciers have
        large moraines,<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href=
        "#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a> and
        many large ones have small moraines. The size of the moraines of any
        glacier depends mainly upon the area of rock surface that is exposed
        to atmospheric influences within the basin drained by the glacier;
        upon the nature of such rock,—whether it is friable or resistant; and
        upon the dip of strata. Moraines most likely will be small if little
        rock surface is exposed; but when large ones are seen, then, in all
        probability, large areas of rock, uncovered by snow or ice, will be
        found in immediate contiguity to the glacier. The Miage glacier has
        large ones, because it receives detritus from many great cliffs and
        ridges. But if this glacier, instead of lying, as it does, at the
        bottom of a trough, were to fill that trough, if it were to
        completely envelope the Aiguille de Trélatête, and the other
        mountains which border it, and were to descend from Mont Blanc
        unbroken by rock or ridge, it would be as destitute of morainic
        matter as the great <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Mer de Glace</span></span> of Greenland. For if
        a country or district is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">completely</span></span> covered up by glacier,
        the moraines may be of the very smallest dimensions.<a id=
        "noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The contributions
        that are supplied to moraines by glaciers themselves, from the
        abrasion of the rocks over which their ice passes, are minute
        compared with the accumulations which are <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>furnished from other sources. These great
        rubbish-heaps are formed, one may say almost entirely, from débris
        which falls, or is washed down the flanks of mountains, or from
        cliffs bordering glaciers; and are composed, to a very limited extent
        only, of matter that is ground, rasped, or filed off by the friction
        of the ice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the contrary
        view were to be adopted, if it could be maintained that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“glaciers, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">by their motion, break off masses of rock from
        the sides and bottoms of their valley courses</span></span>, and
        crowd along every thing that is movable, so as to form large
        accumulations of débris in front, and along their
        sides,”</span><a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href=
        "#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a> the
        conclusion could not be resisted, the greater the glacier, the
        greater should be the moraine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This doctrine does
        not find much favour with those who have personal knowledge of what
        glaciers do at the present time. From De Saussure<a id="noteref_142"
        name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a>
        downwards it has been pointed out, time after time, that moraines are
        chiefly formed from débris coming from rocks or soil <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></span> the
        ice, not from the bed over which it passes. But amongst the writings
        of modern speculators upon glaciers and glacier-action in bygone
        times, it is not uncommon to find the notions entertained, that
        moraines represent the amount of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">excavation</span></span>
        (such is the term employed) performed by glaciers, or at least are
        comprised of matter which has been excavated by glaciers; that vast
        moraines have necessarily been produced by vast glaciers; and that a
        great extension of glaciers necessarily causes the production of vast
        moraines. Such generalisations cannot be sustained.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We descended in
        our track to the Lac de Combal, and from thence went over the Col de
        la Seigne to les Motets, where we slept; on July 13, crossed the Col
        du Mont Tondu to Contamines (in a sharp thunderstorm), and the Col de
        Voza to Chamounix. Two days only remained for excursions in this
        neighbourhood, and we resolved to employ them in another attempt to
        ascend the Aiguille d’Argentière, upon which mountain we had been
        cruelly defeated just eight days before.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It happened in
        this way.—Reilly had a notion that the ascent of the Aiguille could
        be accomplished by following the ridge leading to its summit from the
        Col du Chardonnet. At half-past six, on the morning of the 6th, we
        found ourselves accordingly on the top of that pass. The party
        consisted of our friend Moore and his guide Almer, Reilly and his
        guide François Couttet, myself and Michel Croz. So far the weather
        had been calm, and the way easy; but immediately we arrived on the
        summit of the pass, we got into a furious wind. Five minutes earlier
        we were warm,—now we were frozen. Fine snow whirled up into the air
        penetrated every crack in our harness, and assailed our skins as
        painfully as if it had been red hot instead of freezing cold. The
        teeth chattered involuntarily—talking was laborious; the breath froze
        instantaneously; eating was disagreeable; sitting was impossible!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We looked towards
        our mountain. Its aspect was not encouraging. The ridge that led
        upwards had a spiked arête, palisaded with miniature aiguilles,
        banked up at their bases by heavy snow-beds, which led down, at
        considerable angles, on one side towards the Glacier de Saleinoz, on
        the other towards the Glacier du Chardonnet. Under any circumstances,
        it would have been a stiff piece of work to clamber up that way.
        Prudence and comfort counselled, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give it
        up.”</span> Discretion overruled valour. Moore and Almer crossed the
        Col du Chardonnet to go to Orsières, and we others returned towards
        Chamounix.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when we got
        some distance down, the evil spirit which prompts men to ascend
        mountains tempted us to stop, and to look <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>back at the Aiguille d’Argentière. The sky was
        cloudless; no wind could be felt, nor sign of it perceived; it was
        only eight o’clock in the morning; and there, right before us, we saw
        another branch of the glacier leading high up into the mountain—far
        above the Col du Chardonnet—and a little couloir rising from its head
        almost to the top of the peak. This was clearly the right route to
        take. We turned back, and went at it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The glacier was
        steep, and the snow gully rising out of it was steeper. Seven hundred
        steps were cut. Then the couloir became <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">too</span></span>
        steep. We took to the rocks on its left, and at last gained the
        ridge, at a point about 1500 feet above the Col du Chardonnet. We
        faced about to the right, and went along the ridge; keeping on some
        snow a little below its crest, on the Saleinoz side. Then we got the
        wind again; yet no one thought of turning, for we were within 250
        feet of the summit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The axes of Croz
        and Couttet went to work once more, for the slope was about as steep
        as snow-slope could be. Its surface was covered with a loose,
        granular crust; dry and utterly incoherent; which slipped away in
        streaks directly it was meddled with. The men had to cut through this
        into the old beds underneath, and to pause incessantly to rake away
        the powdery stuff, which poured down in hissing streams over the hard
        substratum. Ugh! how cold it was! How the wind blew! Couttet’s hat
        was torn from its fastenings, and went on a tour in Switzerland. The
        flour-like snow, swept off the ridge above, was tossed spirally
        upwards, eddying in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tourmentes</span></span>; then, dropt in lulls,
        or caught by other gusts, was flung far and wide to feed the
        Saleinoz.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My feet are getting suspiciously numbed,”</span> cried
        Reilly: <span class="tei tei-q">“how about frost-bites?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Kick hard, sir,”</span> shouted the men;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“it’s the only way.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Their</span></span>
        fingers were kept alive by their work; but it was cold for the feet,
        and they kicked and hewed simultaneously. I followed their example
        too violently, and made a hole clean through my footing. A clatter
        followed as if crockery had been thrown down a well.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I went down a step
        or two, and discovered in a second that all were standing over a
        cavern (not a crevasse, speaking properly) that was bridged over by a
        thin vault of ice, from which great icicles hung in groves. Almost in
        the same minute Reilly pushed one of his hands right through the
        roof. The whole party might have tumbled through at any moment.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Go ahead, Croz, we are over a chasm!”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We know it,”</span> he answered,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and we can’t find a firm place.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the blandest
        manner, my comrade inquired if to persevere would not be to do that
        which is called <span class="tei tei-q">“tempting Providence.”</span>
        My reply being in the affirmative, he further observed, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Suppose we go down?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Very willingly.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Ask the
        guides.”</span> They had not the least objection; so we went down,
        and slept that night at the Montanvert.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Off the ridge we
        were out of the wind. In fact, a hundred feet down <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to
        windward</span></span>, on the slope fronting the Glacier du
        Chardonnet, we were broiling hot; there was not a suspicion of a
        breeze. Upon that side there was nothing to tell that a hurricane was
        raging a hundred feet higher,—the cloudless sky looked tranquillity
        itself: whilst to leeward the only sign of a disturbed atmosphere was
        the friskiness of the snow upon the crests of the ridges.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We set out on the
        14th, with Croz, Payot, and Charlet, to finish off the work which had
        been cut short so abruptly, and slept, as before, at the Chalets de
        Lognan. On the 15th, about midday, we arrived upon the summit of the
        aiguille, and found that we had actually been within one hundred feet
        of it when we turned back upon the first attempt.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a triumph
        to Reilly. In this neighbourhood he had performed the feat (in 1863)
        of joining together <span class="tei tei-q">“two mountains, each
        about 13,000 feet high, standing on the map about a mile and a half
        apart.”</span> Long before we made the ascent he had procured
        evidence which could not be impugned, that the Pointe des Plines, a
        fictitious summit which had figured on other maps as a distinct
        mountain, could be no other than the Aiguille d’Argentière,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192"
        id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and he had accordingly
        obliterated it from the preliminary draft of his map. We saw that it
        was right to do so. The Pointe des Plines did not exist. We had
        ocular demonstration of the accuracy of his previous
        observations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I do not know
        which to admire most, the fidelity of Mr. Reilly’s map, or the
        indefatigable industry by which the materials were accumulated from
        which it was constructed. To men who are sound in limb it may be
        amusing to arrive on a summit (as we did upon the top of Mont
        Dolent), sitting astride a ridge too narrow to stand upon; or to do
        battle with a ferocious wind (as we did on the top of the Aiguille de
        Trélatête); or to feel half-frozen in midsummer (as we did on the
        Aiguille d’Argentière). But there is extremely little amusement in
        making sketches and notes under such conditions. Yet upon all these
        expeditions, under the most adverse circumstances, and in the most
        trying situations, Mr. Reilly’s brain and fingers were always at
        work. Throughout all he was ever alike; the same genial,
        equable-tempered companion, whether victorious or whether defeated;
        always ready to sacrifice his own desires to suit our comfort and
        convenience. By a happy union of audacity and prudence, combined with
        untiring perseverance, he eventually completed his self-imposed
        task—a work which would have been intolerable except as a labour of
        love—and which, for a single individual, may well-nigh be termed
        Herculean.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We separated upon
        the level part of the Glacier d’Argentière, Reilly going with Payot

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On July 10, Croz
        and I went to Sierre, in the Valais, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viâ</span></span> the
        Col de Balme, the Col de la Forclaz, and Martigny. The Swiss side of
        the Forclaz is not creditable to Switzerland. The path from Martigny
        to the summit has undergone successive improvements in these latter
        years; but mendicants permanently disfigure it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We passed many
        tired pedestrians toiling up this oven, persecuted by trains of
        parasitic children. These children swarm there like maggots in a
        rotten cheese. They carry baskets of fruit with which to plague the
        weary tourist. They flit around him like flies; they thrust the fruit
        in his face; they pester him with their pertinacity. Beware of
        them!—taste, touch not their fruit. In the eyes of these children,
        each peach, each grape, is worth a prince’s ransom. It is to no
        purpose to be angry; it is like flapping wasps—they only buzz the
        more. Whatever you do, or whatever you say, the end will be the same.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Give me something,”</span> is the alpha and
        omega of all their addresses. They learn the phrase, it is said,
        before they are taught the alphabet. It is in all their mouths. From
        the tiny toddler up to the maiden of sixteen, there is nothing heard
        but one universal chorus of—<span class="tei tei-q">“Give me
        something; will you have the goodness to give me
        something?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From Sierre we
        went up the Val d’Anniviers to Zinal, to join our former companions,
        Moore and Almer. Moore was ambitious to discover a shorter way from
        Zinal to Zermatt than the two <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>passes which were known.<a id="noteref_145"
        name="noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a> He had
        shown to me, upon Dufour’s map, that a direct line, connecting the
        two places, passed exactly over the depression between the
        Zinal-Rothhorn and the Schallhorn. He was confident that a passage
        could be effected over this depression, and was sanguine that it
        would (in consequence of its directness) prove to be a quicker route
        than the circuitous ones over the Triftjoch and the Col Durand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was awaiting
        us, and we immediately proceeded up the valley, and across the foot
        of the Zinal glacier to the Arpitetta Alp, where a chalet was
        supposed to exist in which we might pass the night. We found it at
        length,<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href=
        "#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a> but it
        was not equal to our expectations. It was not one of those fine
        timbered chalets, with huge overhanging eaves, covered with pious
        sentences carved in unintelligible characters. It was a hovel,
        growing, as it were, out of the hill-side; roofed with rough slabs of
        slaty stone; without a door or window; surrounded by quagmires of
        ordure, and dirt of every description.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A foul native
        invited us to enter. The interior was dark; and, when our eyes became
        accustomed to the gloom, we saw that our palace was in plan about 15
        by 20 feet; on one side it was scarcely five feet high, and on the
        other was nearly seven. On this side there was a raised platform,
        about six feet wide, littered with dirty straw and still dirtier
        sheepskins. This was the bedroom. The remainder of the width of the
        apartment was the parlour. The rest was the factory. Cheese was the
        article which was being fabricated, and the foul native was engaged
        in its manufacture. He was garnished behind with a regular cowherd’s
        one-legged stool, which gave him a queer, uncanny look when it was
        elevated in the air as he bent over into his tub; for the making of
        his cheese required him to blow into a tub for ten minutes at a
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195"
        id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>time. He then squatted on his
        stool to gain breath, and took a few whiffs at a short pipe; after
        which he blew away more vigorously than before. We were told that
        this procedure was necessary. It appeared to us to be nasty. It
        accounts, perhaps, for the flavour possessed by certain Swiss
        cheeses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Big, black, and
        leaden-coloured clouds rolled up from Zinal, and met in combat on the
        Moming glacier with others which descended from the Rothhorn. Down
        came the rain in torrents, and crash went the thunder. The herd-boys
        hurried under shelter, for the frightened cattle needed no driving,
        and tore spontaneously down the Alp as if running a steeple-chase.
        Men, cows, pigs, sheep, and goats forgot their mutual animosities,
        and rushed to the only refuge on the mountain. The spell was broken
        which had bound the elements for some weeks past, and the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cirque</span></span> from the Weisshorn to Lo
        Besso was the theatre in which they spent their fury.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A sullen morning
        succeeded an angry night. We were undecided in our council whether to
        advance or to return down the valley. Good seemed likely to overpower
        bad; so, at 5.40, we left the chalet <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">en route</span></span>
        for our pass [amidst the most encouraging assurances from all the
        people on the Alp that we need not distress ourselves about the
        weather, as it was not possible to get to the point at which we were
        aiming].<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href=
        "#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our course led us
        at first over ordinary mountain slopes, and then over a flat expanse
        of glacier. Before this was quitted, it was needful to determine the
        exact line which was to be taken. We were divided betwixt two
        opinions. I advocated that a course should be steered due south, and
        that the upper plateau of the Moming glacier should be attained by
        making a great detour to our right. This was negatived without a
        division. Almer declared in favour of making for some rocks to the
        south-west of the Schallhorn, and attaining the upper plateau of the
        glacier by mounting them. Croz advised a middle course, up some very
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196"
        id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>steep and broken glacier.
        Croz’s route seemed likely to turn out to be impracticable, because
        much step-cutting would be required upon it. Almer’s rocks did not
        look good; they were, possibly, unassailable. I thought both routes
        were bad, and declined to vote for either of them. Moore hesitated,
        Almer gave way, and Croz’s route was adopted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He did not go very
        far, however, before he found that he had undertaken too much, and
        after [glancing occasionally round at us, to see what we thought
        about it, suggested that it might, after all, be wiser to take to the
        rocks of the Schallhorn]. That is to say, he suggested the
        abandonment of his own and the adoption of Almer’s route. No one
        opposed the change of plan, and, in the absence of instructions to
        the contrary, he proceeded to cut steps across an ice-slope towards
        the rocks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let the reader now
        cast his eye upon the <a href="#map2" class="tei tei-ref">map of the
        Valley of Zermatt</a>, and he will see that when we quitted the
        slopes of the Arpitetta Alp, we took a south-easterly course over the
        Moming glacier. We halted to settle the plan of attack shortly after
        we got upon the ice. The rocks of the Schallhorn, whose ascent Almer
        recommended, were then to our south-east. Croz’s proposed route was
        to the south-west of the rocks, and led up the southern side of a
        very steep and broken glacier.<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148"
        href="#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a> The
        part he intended to traverse was, in a sense, undoubtedly
        practicable. He gave it up because it would have involved too much
        step-cutting. But the part of this glacier which intervened between
        his route and Almer’s rocks was, in the most complete sense of the
        word, impracticable. It passed over a continuation of the rocks, and
        was broken in half by them. The upper portion was separated from the
        lower portion by a long slope of ice that had been built up from the
        débris of the glacier which had fallen from above. The foot of this
        slope was surrounded by immense quantities of the larger avalanche
        blocks. These we cautiously skirted, and when Croz halted they had
        been left far below, and we were half-way up <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the side of the great slope which led to the
        base of the ice-wall above.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Across this
        ice-slope Croz now proceeded to cut. It was executing a flank
        movement in the face of an enemy by whom we might be attacked at any
        moment. The peril was obvious. It was a monstrous folly. It was
        foolhardiness. A retreat should have been sounded.<a id="noteref_149"
        name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am not ashamed to confess,”</span> wrote Moore in his
        Journal, <span class="tei tei-q">“that during the whole time we were
        crossing this slope my heart was in my mouth, and I never felt
        relieved from such a load of care as when, after, I suppose, a
        passage of about twenty minutes, we got on to the rocks and were in
        safety.... I have never heard a positive oath come from Almer’s
        mouth, but the language in which he kept up a running commentary,
        more to himself than to me, as we went along, was stronger than I
        should have given him credit for using. His prominent feeling seemed
        to be one of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">indignation</span></span> that we should be in
        such a position, and self-reproach at being a party to the
        proceeding; while the emphatic way in which, at intervals, he
        exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Quick; be quick,’</span>
        sufficiently betokened his alarm.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not
        necessary to admonish Croz to be quick. He was fully as alive to the
        risk as any of the others. He told me afterwards, that this place was
        the most dangerous he had ever crossed, and that no consideration
        whatever would tempt him to cross it again. Manfully did he exert
        himself to escape from the impending destruction. His head, bent down
        to his work, never turned to the right or to the left. One, two,
        three, went his axe, and then he stepped on to the spot where he had
        been cutting. How painfully insecure should we have considered those
        steps at any other time! But now, we thought only of the rocks in
        front, and of the hideous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">séracs</span></span>, lurching over above us,
        apparently in the act of falling.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We got to the
        rocks in safety, and if they had been doubly as difficult as they
        were, we should still have been well content. We sat down and
        refreshed the inner man; keeping our eyes on the towering pinnacles
        of ice under which we had passed; but which, now, were almost beneath
        us. Without a preliminary warning sound, one of the largest—as high
        as the Monument at London Bridge—fell upon the slope below. The
        stately mass heeled over as if upon a hinge (holding together until
        it bent 30 degrees forwards), then it crushed out its base, and, rent
        into a thousand fragments, plunged vertically down upon the slope
        that we had crossed! Every atom of our track, that was in its course,
        was obliterated; all the new snow was swept away, and a broad sheet
        of smooth, glassy ice, showed the resistless force with which it had
        fallen.</p><a name="fig57" id="fig57" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to understand why it was taken. To have
        retreated from the place where Croz suggested a change of plan, to
        have descended below the reach of danger, and to have mounted again
        by the route which Almer suggested, would have been equivalent to
        abandoning the excursion; for no one would have passed another night
        in the chalet on the Arpitetta Alp. <span class=

        word, they fall into irremediable calamities.”</span> Such was nearly
        the case here. No one could say a word in justification of the course
        which was adopted; all were alive to the danger that was being
        encountered; yet a grave risk was deliberately—although
        unwillingly—incurred, in preference to admitting, by withdrawal from

        performed the feats upon the boards of a theatre that he did upon
        this occasion, he would have brought down the house with thunders of
        applause. Here is what Moore wrote in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></span>
        Journal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">[The descent bore
        a strong resemblance to the Col de Pilatte, but was very much steeper
        and altogether more difficult, which is saying a good deal. Croz was
        in his element, and selected his way with marvellous sagacity, while
        Almer had an equally honourable and, perhaps, more responsible post
        in the rear, which he kept with his usual steadiness.... One
        particular passage has impressed itself on my mind as one of the most
        nervous I have ever made. We had to pass along a crest of ice, a mere
        knife-edge,—on our left a broad crevasse, whose bottom was lost in
        blue haze, and on our right, at an angle of 70°, or more, a slope
        falling to a similar gulf below. Croz, as he went along the edge,
        chipped small notches in the ice, in which we placed our feet, with
        the toes well turned out, doing all we knew to preserve our balance.
        While stepping from one of these precarious footholds to another, I
        staggered for a moment. I had not really lost my footing; but the
        agonised tone in which Almer, who was behind me, on seeing me waver,
        exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Slip not, sir!”</span> gave us an
        even livelier impression than we already had of the insecurity of the
        position.... One huge chasm, whose upper edge was far above the lower
        one, could neither be leaped nor turned, and threatened to prove an
        insuperable barrier. But Croz showed himself equal to the emergency.
        Held up by the rest of the party, he cut a series of holes for the
        hands and feet, down and along the almost perpendicular wall of ice
        forming the upper side of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">schrund</span></span>. Down this slippery
        staircase we crept, with our faces to the wall, until a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>point was reached where the width of the
        chasm was not too great for us to drop across. Before we had done, we
        got quite accustomed to taking flying leaps over the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">schrunds</span></span>.... To make a long story
        short; after a most desperate and exciting struggle, and as bad a
        piece of ice-work as it is possible to imagine, we emerged on to the
        upper plateau of the Hohlicht glacier.]</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The glimpses which
        had been caught of the lower part of the Hohlicht glacier were
        discouraging, so it was now determined to cross over the ridge
        between it and the Rothhorn glacier. This was not done without great
        trouble. Again we rose to a height exceeding 12,000 feet. Eventually
        we took to the track of the despised Triftjoch, and descended by the
        well-known, but rough, path which leads to that pass; arriving at the
        Monte Rosa hotel at Zermatt at 7.20 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> We
        occupied nearly twelve hours of actual walking in coming from the
        chalet on the Arpitetta Alp (which was 2½ hours above Zinal), and we
        consequently found that the Moming pass was not the shortest route
        from Zinal to Zermatt, although it was the most direct.</p>

        watching new arrivals, and speculating on the number of francs which
        may be extracted from their pockets. The <span class=

        peeled, blistered, and swollen faces are worth studying. Some, by the
        exercise of watchfulness and unremitting care, have been fortunate
        enough to acquire a fine raw sienna complexion. But most of them have
        not been so happy. They have been scorched on rocks, and roasted on

        time have pulled off large flakes of their skin. They have gone from
        bad to worse—their case has become hopeless—knives and scissors have
        been called into play; tenderly, and daintily, they have endeavoured
        to reduce their cheeks to one, uniform hue. It is not to be done. But
        they have gone on, fascinated, and at last have brought their unhappy
        countenances to a state of helpless and complete ruin. Their lips are

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our career in 1864
        had been one of unbroken success, but the great ascent upon which I
        had set my heart was not attempted, and, until it was accomplished, I
        was unsatisfied. Other things, too, influenced me to visit the Alps
        once more. I wished to travel elsewhere, in places where the
        responsibility of direction would rest with myself alone. It was well
        to know how far my judgment in the choice of routes could be relied
        upon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The journey of
        1865 was chiefly undertaken, then, to find out to what extent I was
        capable to select paths over mountainous country. The programme which
        was drawn up for this journey was rather ambitious, since it included
        almost all of the great peaks which had not then been ascended; but
        it was neither lightly undertaken nor hastily executed. All pains
        were taken to secure success. Information was sought from those who
        could give it, and the defeats of others were studied, that their
        errors might be avoided. The results which followed came not so much,
        perhaps, from luck, as from forethought and careful calculation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For success does
        not, as a rule, come by chance, and when one fails there is a reason
        for it. But when any notable, or so-called brilliant thing is done,
        we are too apt to look upon the success <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>alone, without considering how it was
        accomplished. Whilst, when men fail, we inquire why they have not
        succeeded. So failures are oftentimes more instructive than
        successes, and the disappointments of some become profitable to
        others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up to a certain
        point, the programme was completely and happily carried out. Nothing
        but success attended our efforts so long as the excursions were
        executed as they had been planned. Most of them were made upon the
        very days which had been fixed for them months beforehand; and all
        were accomplished, comparatively speaking, so easily, that their
        descriptions must be, in the absence of difficulty and danger, less
        interesting to the general reader than they would have been if our
        course had been marked by blunders and want of judgment. Before
        proceeding to speak of these excursions, it will not be entirely
        useless to explain the reasons which influenced the selection of the
        routes which were adopted upon them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the course of
        the past five seasons my early practices were revolutionised. My
        antipathy to snow was overcome, and my predilection for rocks was
        modified. Like all those who are not mountaineers born, I was, at the
        first, extremely nervous upon steep snow. The snow seemed bound to
        slip, and all those who were upon it to go along with it. Snow of a
        certain quality is undoubtedly liable to slip when it is at a certain
        inclination.<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href=
        "#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a> The
        exact states which are dangerous, or safe, it is not possible to
        describe in writing. That is only learnt by experience, and
        confidence upon snow is not really felt until one has gained
        experience. Confidence gradually came to me, and as it came so did my
        partiality for rocks diminish. For it was evident, to use a common
        expression, that it paid better to travel upon snow than upon rocks.
        This applies to snow-beds pure and simple, or to snow which is lying
        over glacier; and in the selection of routes it has, latterly, always
        been my practice to look for the places where snow slopes, or
        snow-covered glaciers, reach highest into mountains.<a id=
        "noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
        comparatively seldom, however, that an ascent of a great mountain can
        be executed exclusively upon snow and glacier. Ridges peep through
        which have to be surmounted. In my earlier scramblings I usually took
        to, or was taken upon, the summits (or arêtes) of the ridges, and a
        good many mountaineers habitually take to them on principle, as the
        natural and proper way. According to my experience, it is seldom well
        to do so when any other course is open. As I have already said, and
        presently shall repeat more particularly, the crests of all the main
        ridges of the great peaks of the Alps are shattered and cleft by
        frost; and it not unfrequently happens that a notch in a ridge, which
        appears perfectly insignificant from a distance, is found to be an
        insuperable barrier to farther progress; and a great detour, or a
        long descent, has to be made to avoid the obstacle. When committed to
        an arête one is tied, almost always, to a particular course, from
        which it is difficult to deviate. Much loss of time must result if
        any serious obstruction occurs; and defeat often follows a temporary
        check.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it rarely
        happens that a great alpine peak is seen that is cut off abruptly, in
        all directions, from the snows and glaciers which surround it. In its
        gullies snow will cling, although its faces may be too steep for the
        formation of permanent snow-beds. The merits of these snow-gullies
        (or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">couloirs</span></span>) have been already
        pointed out,<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href=
        "#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a> and it
        is hardly necessary to observe, after that which was just now said
        about snow, that ascents of snow-gullies (with proper precautions)
        are very much to be preferred to ascents of rocky arêtes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By following the
        glaciers, the snow-slopes above, and the couloirs rising from them,
        it is usually possible to get very close to the summits of the great
        peaks in the Alps. The final climb will, perhaps, necessarily be by
        an arête. The less of it the better.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It occasionally
        occurs that considerable mountain slopes, or faces, are destitute of
        snow-gullies. In that case it will, very likely, be best to adhere to
        the faces (or to the gullies or minor ridges upon them) rather than
        to take to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">great</span></span> ridges. Upon a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>face one can move to the right or to the
        left with more facility than upon the crest of a ridge; and when a
        difficulty is arrived at, it is, consequently, less troublesome to
        circumvent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In selecting the
        routes which were taken in 1865, I looked, first, for places where
        glaciers and snow extended highest up into the mountains which were
        to be ascended, or the ridges which were to be crossed. Next, for
        gullies filled with snow leading still higher; and finally, from the
        heads of the gullies we completed the ascents, whenever it was
        practicable, by faces instead of by arêtes. The ascent of the Grand
        Cornier (13,022), of the Dent Blanche (14,318), Grandes Jorasses
        (13,700), Aiguille Verte (13,540), Ruinette (12,727), and the
        Matterhorn (14,780), were all accomplished in this way; besides the
        other excursions which will be referred to by and by. The route
        selected, before the start was made, was in every case strictly
        followed out.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We inspected all
        of these mountains from neighbouring heights before entering upon
        their ascents. I explained to the guides the routes I proposed to be
        taken, and (when the courses were at all complicated) sketched them
        out on paper to prevent misunderstanding. In some few cases they
        suggested variations, and in every case the route was well discussed.
        The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">execution</span></span> of the work was done by
        the guides, and I seldom interfered with, or attempted to assist in
        it.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">
          &nbsp;
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The 13th of June
        1865 I spent in the valley of Lauterbrunnen with the Rev. W. H.
        Hawker and the guides Christian and Ulrich Lauener; and on the 14th
        crossed the Petersgrat with Christian Almer and Johann Tännler to
        Turtman (Tourtemagne) in the Valais. Tännler was then paid off, as
        Michel Croz and Franz Biener were awaiting me.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not
        possible to find two leading guides who worked together more
        harmoniously than Croz and Almer. Biener’s part was subordinate to
        theirs, and he was added as a convenience rather than as a necessity.
        Croz spoke French alone, Almer little else than German. Biener spoke
        both languages, and was useful on <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>that account; but he seldom went to the front,
        excepting during the early part of the day, when the work was easy,
        and he acted throughout more as a porter than as a guide.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The importance of
        having a reserve of power on mountain expeditions cannot be too
        strongly insisted upon. We always had some in hand, and were never
        pressed, or overworked, so long as we were together. Come what might,
        we were ready for it. But by a series of chances, which I shall never
        cease to regret, I was first obliged to part with Croz, and then to
        dismiss the others;<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href=
        "#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        deviating from the course that I had deliberately adopted, which was
        successful in practice because it was sound in principle, became
        fortuitously a member of an expedition that ended with the
        catastrophe which brings this book, and brought my scrambles amongst
        the Alps, to a close.<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On June 15 we
        went, from Turtman to Z’meiden, and thence over the Forcletta pass to
        Zinal. We diverged from the summit of the pass up some neighbouring
        heights to inspect the Grand Cornier, and I decided to have nothing
        to do with its northern side. It seemed quite safe to pronounce it
        inaccessible from that direction, although it was more than seven
        miles away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 16th we
        left Zinal at 2.5 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span>, having been for a moment greatly
        surprised by an entry in the hotel-book,<a id="noteref_158" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a> and
        ascending by the Zinal glacier, and giving the base of our mountain a
        wide berth in order that it might be better examined, passed
        gradually right round to its south, before a way up it was
        seen.<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href=
        "#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a> At 8.30
        we arrived upon the plateau of the glacier that descends towards the
        east, between the Grand Cornier and the Dent Blanche, and from this
        place a route was readily traced. We steered to the north (as shown
        upon the <a href="#map2" class="tei tei-ref">map</a>) over the
        glacier, towards the ridge that descends to the east; gained it by
        mounting snow-slopes, and followed it to the summit, which was
        arrived at before half-past twelve. From first to last the route was
        almost entirely over snow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ridges leading
        to the north and to the south from the summit of the Grand Cornier,
        exhibited in a most striking manner the extraordinary effects that
        may be produced by violent alternations of heat and cold. The
        southern one was hacked and split into the wildest forms; and the
        northern one was not less cleft and impracticable, and offered the
        droll piece of rock-carving which is represented upon <a href=
        "#fig61" class="tei tei-ref">page 211</a>. Some small blocks actually
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210"
        id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tottered and fell before our
        eyes, and, starting others in their downward course, grew into a
        perfect avalanche, which descended with a solemn roar on to the
        glaciers beneath.</p><a name="fig60" id="fig60" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is natural that
        the great ridges should present the wildest forms—not on account of
        their dimensions, but by reason of their positions. They are exposed
        to the fiercest heat of the sun, and are seldom in shadow as long as
        it is above the horizon. They are entirely unprotected, and are
        attacked by the strongest blasts and by the most intense cold. The
        most durable rocks are not proof against such assaults. These grand,
        apparently solid—eternal—mountains, seeming so firm, so immutable,
        are yet ever changing and crumbling into dust. These shattered ridges
        are evidence of their sufferings. Let me repeat that every principal
        ridge of every great peak in the Alps amongst those I have seen has
        been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name=
        "Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shattered in this way;
        and that every summit, amongst the rock-summits upon which I have
        stood, has been nothing but a piled-up heap of fragments.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The minor ridges
        do not usually present such extraordinary forms as the principal
        ones. They are less exposed, and they are less broken up; and it is
        reasonable to assume that their annual degradation is less than that
        of the summit-ridges.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wear and tear
        does not cease even in winter, for these great ridges are never
        completely covered up by snow,<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160"
        href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a> and the
        sun has still power. The destruction is incessant, and increases as
        time goes on; for the greater the surfaces which are exposed to the
        practically inexhaustible powers of sun and frost, the greater ruin
        will be effected.</p><a name="fig61" id="fig61" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rock-falls
        which are continually occurring upon all rock mountains (such as are
        referred to upon pp. <a href="#Pg029" class="tei tei-ref">29</a>,
        <a href="#Pg055" class="tei tei-ref">55</a>) are, of course,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212"
        id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>caused by these powers. No one
        doubts it; but one never believes it so thoroughly as when the
        quarries are seen from which their materials have been hewn; and when
        the germs, so to speak, of these avalanches have been seen actually
        starting from above.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These falls of
        rock take place from two causes. First, from the heat of the sun
        detaching small stones or rocks which have been arrested on ledges or
        slopes and bound together by snow or ice. I have seen such released
        many times when the sun has risen high; fall gently at first, gather
        strength, grow in volume, and at last rush down with a cloud trailing
        behind, like the dust after an express train. Secondly, from the
        freezing of the water which trickles, during the day, into the
        clefts, fissures, and crannies. This agency is naturally most active
        in the night, and then, or during very cold weather, the greatest
        falls take place.<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href=
        "#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When one has
        continually seen and heard these falls, it is easily understood why
        the glaciers are laden with moraines. The wonder is, not that they
        are sometimes so great, but that they are not always greater.
        Irrespective of lithological considerations, one knows that this
        débris cannot have been excavated <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></span> the
        glaciers. The moraines are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">borne</span></span> by glaciers, but they are
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">born</span></span> from the ridges. They are
        generated by the sun, and delivered by the frost. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Fire,”</span> it is well said in Plutarch’s life of
        Camillus, <span class="tei tei-q">“is the most active thing in
        nature, and all generation is motion, or at least, with motion; all
        other parts of matter without warmth lie sluggish and dead, and crave
        the influence of heat as their life, and when that comes upon them,
        they immediately acquire some active or passive
        qualities.”</span><a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href=
        "#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the Alps were
        granted a perfectly invariable temperature, if they were no longer
        subjected, alternately, to freezing blasts and to scorching heat,
        they might more correctly be termed <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“eternal.”</span> They might still continue to decay, but
        their abasement would be much less rapid.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When rocks are
        covered up by a sheet of glacier they do enjoy an almost invariable
        temperature. The extremes of summer and winter are unknown to rocks
        which are so covered up,—a range of a very few degrees is the most
        that is possible underneath the ice.<a id="noteref_163" name=
        "noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a> There
        is, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">then</span></span>, little or no disintegration
        from unequal expansion and contraction. Frost, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></span>,
        does not penetrate into the heart of the rock, and cleave off vast
        masses. The rocks, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">then</span></span>, sustain grinding instead of
        cleaving. Atoms, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">then</span></span>, come away instead of masses.
        Fissures and overhanging surfaces are bridged, for the ice cannot get
        at them; and after many centuries of grinding have been sustained, we
        still find numberless angular surfaces (in the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">lee-sides</span></span>) which were fashioned
        before the ice began to work.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The points of
        difference which are so evident between the operations of heat, cold,
        and water, and those of glaciers upon rocks, are as follow. The
        former take advantage of cracks, fissures, joints, and soft places;
        the latter do not. The former can work <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">underneath</span></span> overhanging masses; the
        latter cannot. The effects produced by the former continually
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">increase</span></span>, because they continually
        expose fresh surfaces by forming new cracks, fissures, and holes. The
        effects which the latter produce constantly <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">diminish</span></span>,
        because the area of the surfaces operated upon becomes less and less,
        as they become smoother and flatter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What can one
        conclude, then, but that sun, frost, and water, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>have had infinitely more to do than
        glaciers with the fashioning of mountain-forms and valley-slopes? Who
        can refuse to believe that powers which are at work everywhere, which
        have been at work always, which are so incomparably active, capable,
        and enduring, must have produced greater effects than a solitary
        power which is always local in its influence, which has worked,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">comparatively</span></span>, but for a short
        time, which is always slow and feeble in its operations, and which
        constantly diminishes in intensity?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet there are some
        who refuse to believe that sun, frost, and water have played an
        important part in modelling the Alps, and hold it as an article of
        their faith that the Alpine region <span class="tei tei-q">“owes its
        present conformation mainly to the action of its ancient

        18, 1862, and ascending the glacier that is mentioned in the opening
        paragraph, went towards the point marked 3912 mètres upon the

        turned to the left (that is, to the north), and completed the ascent
        by the southern ridge—that which overhangs the western side of the
        Schönbühl glacier.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Kennedy
        described his expedition in a very interesting paper in the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alpine
        Journal</span></span>. His account bore the impress of truth; yet
        unbelievers said that it was impossible to have told (in weather such
        as was experienced) whether the summit had actually been attained,
        and sometimes roundly asserted that the mountain, as the saying is,
        still remained virgin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I did not share
        these doubts, although they influenced me to make the ascent. I
        thought it might be possible to find an easier route than that taken
        by Mr. Kennedy, and that if we succeeded in discovering one we should
        be able at once to refute his traducers, and to vaunt our superior
        wisdom. Actuated by these elevated motives, I halted my little army
        at the foot of the glacier, and inquired, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Which is best for us to do?—to ascend the Dent Blanche,
        or to cross to Zermatt?”</span> They answered, with befitting
        solemnity, <span class="tei tei-q">“We think Dent Blanche is
        best.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the chalets
        of Abricolla the south-west face of the Dent Blanche is regarded
        almost exactly in profile. From thence it is seen that the angle of
        the face scarcely exceeds thirty degrees, and after observing this I
        concluded that the face would, in all probability, give an easier
        path to the summit than the crest of the very jagged ridge which was
        followed by Mr. Kennedy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We zigzagged up
        the glacier along the foot of the face, and looked for a way on to
        it. We looked for some time in vain, for a mighty <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bergschrund</span></span> effectually prevented
        approach, and, like a fortress’ moat, protected the wall from
        assault. We went up and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg
        217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>up,
        until, I suppose, we were not more than a thousand feet below the
        point marked 3912 mètres; then a bridge was discovered, and we
        dropped down on hands and knees to cross it.</p><a name="fig63" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A bergschrund, it
        was said on <a href="#Pg182" class="tei tei-ref">p. 182</a>, is a
        schrund, and something more than a schrund. A schrund is simply a big
        crevasse. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg
        218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>A
        bergschrund is frequently, although not always, a big crevasse. The
        term is applied to the last of the crevasses that one finds, in
        ascending, before quitting the glacier, and taking to the rocks which
        bound it. It is the mountains’ schrund. Sometimes it is <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></span>
        large, but early in the season (that is to say in the month of June
        or before) bergschrunds are usually snowed up, or well bridged over,
        and do not give much trouble. Later in the year, say in August, they
        are frequently very great hindrances, and occasionally are completely
        impassable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They are lines of
        rupture consequent upon unequal motion. The glaciers below move
        quicker than the snow or ice which clings immediately to the
        mountains; hence these fissures result. The slower motion of that
        which is above can only be attributed to its having to sustain
        greater friction; for the rule is that the upper portion is set at a
        steeper angle than the lower. As that is the case, we should expect
        that the upper portion would move <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quicker</span></span>
        than the lower, and it would do so, doubtless, but for the
        retardation of the rocks over which, and through which, it
        passes.<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href=

          &nbsp;
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We crossed the
        bergschrund of the Dent Blanche, I suppose, at a height of about
        12,000 feet above the level of the sea. Our work may be said to have
        commenced at that point. The face, although not steep in its general
        inclination, was so cut up by little ridges and cliffs, and so seamed
        with incipient couloirs, that it had all the difficulty of a much
        more precipitous slope. The difficulties were never great, but they
        were numerous, and made a very respectable total when put together.
        We passed the bergschrund soon after nine in the morning, and during
        the next eleven hours halted only five-and-forty minutes. The whole
        of the remainder of the time was occupied in ascending and descending
        the 2400 feet which compose this south-western face; and inasmuch as
        1000 feet per hour (taking the mean of ascent and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>descent) is an ordinary rate of
        progression, it is tolerably certain that the Dent Blanche is a
        mountain of exceptional difficulty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hindrances
        opposed to us by the mountain itself were, however, as nothing
        compared with the atmospheric obstructions. It is true there was
        plenty of, <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you fast, Almer?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Go
        ahead, Biener.”</span> Biener, made secure, cried, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come on, sir,”</span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monsieur</span></span>
        endeavoured. <span class="tei tei-q">“No, no,”</span> said Almer,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“not there,—<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">here</span></span>,”</span>—pointing with his
        bâton to the right place to clutch. Then ’twas Croz’s turn, and we
        all drew in the rope as the great man followed. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Forwards”</span> once more—and so on.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Five hundred feet
        of this kind of work had been accomplished when we were saluted (not
        entirely unexpectedly) by the first gust of a hurricane which was
        raging above. The day was a lovely one for dwellers in the valleys,
        but we had, long ago, noted some light, gossamer clouds, that were
        hovering round our summit, being drawn out in a suspicious manner
        into long, silky threads. Croz, indeed, prophesied before we had
        crossed the schrund, that we should be beaten by the wind, and had
        advised that we should return. But I had retorted, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No, my good Croz, you said just now <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Dent Blanche is best’</span>; we must go up the Dent
        Blanche.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have a very
        lively and disagreeable recollection of this wind. Upon the outskirts
        of the disturbed region it was only felt occasionally. It then seemed
        to make rushes at one particular man, and when it had discomfited
        him, it whisked itself away to some far-off spot, only to return,
        presently, in greater force than before.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My old enemy—the
        Matterhorn—seen across the basin of the Z’Muttgletscher, looked
        totally unassailable. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you think,”</span>
        the men asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“that you, or any one else,
        will ever get up <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">that</span></span> mountain?”</span> And when,
        undismayed by their ridicule, I stoutly answered, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, but not upon that side,”</span> they burst into
        derisive chuckles. I must confess that my hopes sank; for nothing can
        look more completely inaccessible than the Matterhorn on its northern
        and north-west sides.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg
        220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Forwards”</span> once again. We overtopped the Dent
        d’Hérens. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not a thousand feet more; in three
        hours we shall be on the summit.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“You
        mean <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ten</span></span>,”</span> echoed Croz, so slow
        had been the progress. But I was not far wrong in the estimate. At
        3.15 we struck the great ridge followed by Mr. Kennedy, close to the
        top of the mountain. The wind and cold were terrible there. Progress
        was oftentimes impossible, and we waited, crouching under the lee of
        rocks, listening to <span class="tei tei-q">“the shrieking of the
        mindless wind,”</span> while the blasts swept across, tearing off the
        upper snow and blowing it away in streamers over the Schönbühl
        glacier—<span class="tei tei-q">“nothing seen except an indescribable
        writhing in the air, like the wind made visible.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our goal was
        concealed by mist, although it was only a few yards away, and Croz’s
        prophecy, that we should stay all night upon the summit, seemed
        likely to come true. The men rose with the occasion, although even
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">their</span></span> fingers had nearly lost
        sensation. There were no murmurings, nor suggestions of return, and
        they pressed on for the little white cone which they knew must be
        near at hand. Stopped again; a big mass perched loosely on the ridge
        barred the way; we could not crawl over, and scarcely dared creep
        round it. The wine went round for the last time. The liquor was
        half-frozen,—still we would more of it. It was all gone; the bottle
        was left behind, and we pushed on, for there was a lull.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The end came
        almost before it was expected. The clouds opened, and I saw that we
        were all but upon the highest point, and that, between us and it,
        about twenty yards off, there was a little artificial pile of stones.
        Kennedy was a true man,—it was a cairn which he had erected.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What is that, Croz?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Homme des pierres</span></span>,”</span> he
        bawled. It was needless to proceed farther; I jerked the rope from
        Biener, and motioned that we should go back. He did the same to
        Almer, and we turned immediately. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They</span></span> did
        not see the stones (they were cutting footsteps), and misinterpreted
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221"
        id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the reason of the retreat.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We commenced the
        descent of the face. It was hideous work. The men looked like
        impersonations of Winter, with their hair all frosted, and their
        beards matted with ice. My hands were numbed—dead. I begged the
        others to stop. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We cannot afford to
        stop; we must continue to move</span></span>,”</span> was their
        reply. They were right; to stop was to be entirely frozen. So we went
        down; gripping rocks varnished with ice, which pulled the skin from
        the fingers. Gloves were useless; they became iced too, and the
        bâtons slid through them as slippery as eels. The iron of the axes
        stuck to the fingers—it felt red-hot; but it was useless to shrink,
        the rocks and the axes had to be firmly grasped—no faltering would do
        here.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We turned back at
        4.12 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span>, and at 8.15 crossed the
        bergschrund again, not having halted for a minute upon the entire
        descent. During the last two hours it was windless, but time was of
        such vital importance that we pressed on incessantly, and did not
        stop until we were fairly upon the glacier. Then we took stock of
        what remained of the tips of our fingers. There was not much skin
        left; they were perfectly raw, and for weeks afterwards I was
        reminded of the ascent of the Dent Blanche by the twinges which I
        felt when I pulled on my boots. The others escaped with some slight
        frost-bites; and, altogether, we had reason to congratulate ourselves
        that we got off so lightly. The men complimented me upon the descent,
        and I could do the same honestly to them. If they had worked less
        vigorously, or harmoniously, we should have been benighted upon the
        face, where there was not a single spot upon which it was possible to
        sit; and if that had happened, I do not think that one would have
        survived to tell the tale.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We made the
        descent of the glacier in a mist, and of the <span class="tei tei-pb"

        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> on the 18th, had not Biener asked
        to be allowed to go to mass at Evolène, a village about two and a
        half hours from Abricolla. He received permission, on the condition
        that he returned not later than mid-day, but he did not come back
        until 2.30 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span>, and we thereby got into a pretty
        little mess.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pass which we
        were about to traverse to Zermatt—the Col d’Hérens—is one of the few
        glacier-passes in this district which have been known almost from
        time immemorial. It is frequently crossed in the summer season, and
        is a very easy route, notwithstanding that the summit of the pass is
        11,417 feet above the level of the sea.<a id="noteref_173" name=
        "noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From Abricolla to
        the summit the way lies chiefly over the flat Glacier de Ferpècle.
        The walk is of the most straightforward kind. The glacier rises in
        gentle undulations; its crevasses are small and easily avoided; and
        all you have to do, after once getting upon the ice, is to proceed
        due south, in the most direct manner possible. If you do so, in two
        hours you should be upon the summit of the pass.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We tied ourselves
        in line, of course, when we entered upon the <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>glacier, and placed Biener to lead, as he had
        frequently crossed the pass; supposing that his local knowledge might
        save us some time upon the other side. We had proceeded, I believe,
        about half-way up, when a little, thin cloud dropped down upon us
        from above. It was so light and gauzy, that we did not for a moment
        suppose it would become embarrassing, and hence I neglected to note
        at the proper moment the course which we should steer,—that is to
        say, to observe our precise situation, in regard to the summit of the
        pass.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some little
        time Biener progressed steadily, making a tolerably straight track;
        but at length he wavered, and deviated sometimes to the right, and
        sometimes to the left. Croz rushed forward directly he saw this, and
        taking the poor young man by his shoulders gave him a good shaking,
        told him that he was an imbecile, to untie himself at once, and to go
        to the rear. Biener looked half-frightened, and obeyed without a
        murmur. Croz led off briskly, and made a good straight track for a
        few minutes. Then, it seemed to me, he began to move steadily round
        to the left. I looked back, but the mist was now too thick to see our
        traces, and so we continued to follow our leader. At last the others
        (who were behind, and in a better position to judge) thought the same
        as I did, and we pulled up Croz to deliver our opinion. He took our
        criticism in good part, but when Biener opened his mouth that was too
        much for him to stand, and he told the young man again, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">You</span></span> are imbecile; I bet you twenty
        francs to one that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">my</span></span> track is better than
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yours</span></span>; twenty francs, now then,
        imbecile!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almer went to the
        front. He commenced by returning in the track for a hundred yards or
        so, and then started off at a tangent from Croz’s curve. We kept this
        course for half-an-hour, and then were certain that we were not on
        the right route, because the snow became decidedly steep. We bore
        away more and more to the right, to avoid this steep bank, but at
        last I rebelled, as we had for some time been going almost
        south-west, which was altogether the wrong direction. After a long
        discussion we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg
        225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>returned some distance in our track, and then
        steered a little east of south, but we continually met steep
        snow-slopes, and to avoid them went right or left as the case might
        require.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We were greatly
        puzzled, and could not in the least tell whether we were too near the
        Dent Blanche or too close to the Tête Blanche. The mists had
        thickened, and were now as dense as a moderate London fog. There were
        no rocks or echoes to direct us, and the guidance of the compass
        brought us invariably against these steep snow-banks. The men were
        fairly beaten; they had all had a try, or more than one, and at last
        gave it up as a bad job, and asked what was to be done. It was 7.30
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> and only an hour of daylight was
        left. We were beginning to feel used up, for we had wandered about at
        tip-top speed for the last three hours and a half, so I said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“This is my advice; let us turn in our track,
        and go back as hard as ever we can, not quitting the track for an
        instant.”</span> They were well content, but just as we were starting
        off, the clouds lifted a little, and we thought we saw the Col. It
        was then to our right, and we went at it with a dash. Before we had
        gone a hundred paces down came the mist again. We kept on
        nevertheless for twenty minutes, and then, as darkness was
        perceptibly coming on, and the snow was yet rising in front, we
        turned back, and by running down the entire distance managed to get
        clear of the Ferpècle glacier just as it became pitch dark. We
        arrived at our cheerless chalet in due course, and went to bed
        supperless, for our food was gone; all very sulky—not to say
        savage—agreeing in nothing except in bullying Biener.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At 7 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> on the
        19th, we set out, for the third time, for the Col d’Hérens. It was a
        fine day, and we gradually recovered our tempers as we saw the
        follies which had been committed on the previous evening. Biener’s
        wavering track was not so bad; but Croz had swerved from the right
        route from the first, and had traced a complete semicircle, so that
        when we stopped him we were facing Abricolla—whence we had started.
        Almer had commenced with great discretion; but he kept on too long,
        and crossed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg
        226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        proper route. When I stopped them (because we were going south-west),
        we were a long way up the Tête Blanche! Our last attempt was in the
        right direction; we were actually upon the summit of the pass, and in
        another ten yards we should have commenced to go down hill! It is
        needless to point out that if the compass had been looked to at the
        proper moment—that is, immediately the mist came down—we should have
        avoided all our troubles. It was little use afterwards, except to
        tell us when we were going <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">wrong</span></span>. We arrived at Zermatt in
        six and a half hours’ walking from Abricolla, and Seller’s hospitable
        reception set us all right again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 20th we
        crossed the Théodule pass, and diverged from its summit up the
        Théodulhorn (11,391) to examine a route which I suggested for the
        ascent of the Matterhorn. Before continuing an account of our
        proceedings, I must stop for a minute to explain why this new route
        was proposed, in place of that up the south-western ridge.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The main peak of
        the Matterhorn may be divided into three sections.<a id="noteref_174"
        name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a> The
        first, facing the Z’Muttgletscher, looks completely unassailable; the
        second, facing the east, seems inaccessibility itself; whilst the
        third, facing Breil, does not look entirely hopeless. It was from
        this last direction that all my previous attempts were made. It was
        by the south-western ridge, it will be remembered, that not only I,
        but Mr. Hawkins, Professor Tyndall, and the chasseurs of Val
        Tournanche, essayed to climb the mountain. Why then abandon a route
        which had been shown to be feasible up to a certain point?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I gave it up for
        four reasons. 1. On account of my growing disinclination for arêtes,
        and preference for snow and rock-faces (see <a href="#Pg204" class=
        "tei tei-ref">Chap. XII.</a>). 2. Because I was persuaded that
        meteorological disturbances (by which we had been baffled several
        times) might be expected to occur again and again<a id="noteref_175"
        name="noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a> (see
        Chaps. IV. and VI.). <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg
        227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>3.
        Because I found that the east face was a gross imposition—it looked
        not far from perpendicular; while its angle was, in fact, scarcely
        more than 40°. 4. Because I observed for myself that the strata of
        the mountain dipped to the west-south-west. It is not necessary to
        say anything more than has been already said upon the first two of
        these four points, but upon the latter two a few words are
        indispensable. Let us consider, first, why most persons receive such
        an exaggerated impression of the steepness of the eastern
        face.</p><a name="plate10" id="plate10" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When one looks at
        the Matterhorn from Zermatt, the mountain is regarded (nearly) from
        the north-east. The face that fronts the east is consequently neither
        seen in profile nor in full front, but almost half-way between the
        two; it looks, therefore, more steep than it really is. The majority
        of those who visit Zermatt go up to the Riffelberg, or to the
        Gornergrat, and from these places, the mountain naturally looks still
        more precipitous, because its eastern face (which is almost all that
        is seen of it) is viewed more directly in front. From the Riffel
        hotel the slope seems to be set at an angle of 70°. If the tourist
        continues to go southwards, and crosses the Théodule pass, he gets,
        at one point, immediately in front of the eastern face, which then
        seems to be absolutely perpendicular. Comparatively few persons
        correct the erroneous impressions they receive in these quarters by
        studying the face in profile, and most go away with a very incorrect
        and exaggerated idea of the precipitousness of this side of the
        mountain, because they have considered the question from one point of
        view alone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Several years
        passed away before I shook myself clear of my early and false
        impressions regarding the steepness of this side of the Matterhorn.
        First of all, I noticed that there were places on this eastern face
        where snow remained permanently all the year round. I do not speak of
        snow in gullies, but of the considerable slopes which are seen upon
        the accompanying engraving, about half-way up the face. Such beds as
        these could not continue to remain throughout the summer, unless the
        snow had been able to accumulate in the winter in large masses; and
        snow cannot accu<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg
        228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>mulate and remain in large masses, in a
        situation such as this, at angles much exceeding 45°.<a id=
        "noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a> Hence I
        was bound to conclude that the eastern face was many degrees removed
        from perpendicularity; and, to be sure on this point, I went to the
        slopes between the Z’Muttgletscher and the Matterhorngletscher, above
        the chalets of Staffel, whence the face could be seen in profile. Its
        appearance from this direction would be amazing to one who had seen
        it only from the east. It looks so totally different from the
        apparently sheer and perfectly unclimbable cliff one sees from the
        Riffelberg, that it is hard to believe the two slopes are one and the
        same thing. Its angle scarcely exceeds 40°.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A great step was
        made when this was learnt. This knowledge alone would not, however,
        have caused me to try an ascent by the eastern face instead of by the
        south-west ridge. Forty degrees may not seem a formidable inclination
        to the reader, nor is it for only a small cliff. But it is very
        unusual to find so steep a gradient maintained continuously as the
        general angle of a great mountain-slope, and very few instances can
        be quoted from the High Alps of such an angle being preserved over a
        rise of 3000 feet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I do not think
        that the steepness or the height of this cliff would have deterred
        climbers from attempting to ascend it, if it had not, in addition,
        looked so repulsively smooth. Men despaired of finding anything to
        grasp. Now, some of the difficulties of the south-west ridge came
        from the smoothness of the rocks, although that ridge, even from a
        distance, seemed to be well broken up. How much greater, then, might
        not have been the difficulty of climbing a face which looked smooth
        and unbroken close at hand?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A more serious
        hindrance to mounting the south-west ridge is found in the dip of its
        rocks to the west-south-west. The great mass of the Matterhorn, it is
        now well ascertained, is composed of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>regularly stratified rocks,<a id="noteref_177"
        name="noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> which
        rise towards the east. It has been mentioned in the text, more than
        once, that the rocks on some portions of the ridge leading from the
        Col du Lion to the summit dip outwards, and that fractured edges
        overhang.<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href=
        "#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> This is
        shown in the illustrations facing <a href="#plate04" class=

        "tei tei-ref">84</a>; and the annexed diagram, Fig. 1, exhibits the
        same thing still more clearly. It will be readily understood that
        such an arrangement is not favourable for climbers, and that the
        degree of facility with which rocks can be ascended that are so
        disposed, must depend very much upon the frequency or paucity of
        fissures and joints. The rocks of the south-west ridge are
        sufficiently provided with cracks, but if it were otherwise, their
        texture and arrangement would render them unassailable.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not possible
        to go a single time upon the rocks of the south-west ridge, from the
        Col du Lion to the foot of the Great Tower, without observing the
        prevalence of their outward dip, and that their fractured edges have
        a tendency to overhang; nor can one fail to notice that it is upon
        this account the débris, which is rent off by frost, does not remain
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in
        situ</span></span>, but pours down in showers over the surrounding
        cliffs. Each day’s work, so to speak, is cleared away; the ridge is
        swept clean; there is scarcely anything seen but firm rock.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact that the
        mountain is composed of a series of stratified beds was pointed out
        long ago. De Saussure remarked it, and recorded explicitly, in his
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Travels</span></span> (§ 2243), that they
        <span class="tei tei-q">“rose to the north-east at an angle of about
        45°.”</span> Forbes noticed it also; and gave it as his opinion that
        the beds were <span class="tei tei-q">“less inclined, or nearly
        horizontal.”</span> He added, <span class="tei tei-q">“De Saussure is
        no doubt correct.”</span><a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href=
        "#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a> The
        truth, I think, lies between the two.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was acquainted
        with both of the above-quoted passages, but did not turn the
        knowledge to any practical account until I re-observed the same fact
        for myself. It was not until after my repulse in 1863, that I
        referred the peculiar difficulties of the south-west ridge to the dip
        of the strata; but when once persuaded that structure and not texture
        was the real impediment, it was reasonable to infer that the opposite
        side, that is to say the eastern face, might be comparatively easy.
        In brief, that an arrangement should be found like <a href="#fig65"
        class="tei tei-ref">Fig. 2</a>, instead of like <a href="#fig65"
        class="tei tei-ref">Fig. 1</a>. This trivial deduction was the key to
        the ascent of the Matterhorn.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The point was, Did
        the strata continue with a similar dip throughout the mountain? If
        they did, then this great eastern face, instead of being hopelessly
        impracticable, should be quite the reverse.—In fact, it should be a
        great natural staircase, with steps inclining inwards; and, if it
        were so, its smooth aspect might be of no account, for the smallest
        steps, inclined in this fashion, would afford good footing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They did so, as
        far as one could judge from a distance. When snow fell in the summer
        time, it brought out long, terraced lines upon the mountain; rudely
        parallel to each other; inclined in the direction shown
        (approximately) upon the figures in the accompanying plate; and the
        eastern face, on those occasions, was often whitened almost
        completely over; while the other sides, with the <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The very outline
        of the mountain, too, confirmed the conjecture that its structure
        would assist an ascent on the eastern face, although it opposed one
        on all other sides. Look at any photograph of the peak from the
        north-east (or, failing one, the <a href="#plate11" class=
        "tei tei-ref">outline facing page 230</a>, which is carefully traced
        from one), and you will see that upon the right-hand side (that
        facing the Z’Muttgletscher) there is an incessant repetition of
        overhanging cliffs, and of slopes all trending downwards; in short,
        that the character of the whole of that side is similar to <a href=
        "#fig65" class="tei tei-ref">Fig. 1, p. 229</a>; and that upon the
        left hand (or south-east) ridge, the forms, as far as they go, are
        suggestive of the structure of <a href="#fig65" class=
        "tei tei-ref">Fig. 2</a>. There is no doubt that the contours of the
        mountain, seen from this direction, have been largely influenced by
        the direction of its beds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not,
        therefore, from a freak, that I invited Mr. Reilly to join in an
        attack upon the eastern face, but from a gradually-acquired
        conviction that it would prove to give the easiest path to the
        summit; and, if we had not been obliged to part, the mountain would,
        doubtless, have been ascended in 1864.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">
          &nbsp;
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My guides readily
        admitted that they had been greatly deceived as to the steepness of
        the eastern face, when they were halted to look at it in profile, as
        we came down the Z’Muttgletscher, on our way to Zermatt; but they
        were far from being satisfied that it would turn out to be easy to
        climb, and Almer and Biener expressed themselves decidedly averse to
        making an attempt upon it. I gave way temporarily before their
        evident reluctance, and we made the ascent of the Théodulhorn to
        examine an alternative route, which I expected would commend itself
        to them in preference to the other, as a great part of it led over
        snow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is an
        immense gully in the Matterhorn, which leads up from the Glacier du
        Mont Cervin to a point high up on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a> I
        proposed to ascend this to its head, and to cross over the south-east
        ridge on to the eastern face. This would have brought us on a level
        with the bottom of the great snow-slope shown upon the centre of the
        eastern face in the engraving facing <a href="#plate10" class=
        "tei tei-ref">p. 227</a>. This snow-slope was to be crossed
        diagonally, with the view of arriving at the snow upon the north-east
        ridge, which is shown upon the same engraving, about half-an-inch
        from the summit. The remainder of the ascent was to be made by the
        broken rocks, mixed with snow, upon the north side of the mountain.
        Croz caught the idea immediately, and thought the plan feasible;
        details were settled, and we descended to Breil. Luc Meynet, the
        hunchback, was summoned, and expressed himself delighted to resume
        his old vocation of tent-bearer; and Favre’s kitchen was soon in
        commotion preparing three days’ rations, for I intended to take that
        amount of time over the affair—to sleep on the first night upon the
        rocks at the top of the gully; to make a push for the summit, and to
        return to the tent on the second day; and upon the third to come back
        to Breil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We started at 5.45
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> on June 21, and followed the
        route of the Breuiljoch<a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href=
        "#note_183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a> for
        three hours. We were then in full view of our gully, and turned off
        at right angles for it. The closer we approached, the more favourable
        did it look. There was a good deal of snow in it, which was evidently
        at a small angle, and it seemed as if one-third of the ascent, at
        least, would be a very simple matter. Some suspicious marks in the
        snow at its base suggested that it was not free from falling stones,
        and, as a measure of precaution, we turned off on one side, worked up
        under cover of the cliffs, and waited to see if anything should
        descend. Nothing fell, so we proceeded up its right or northern side,
        sometimes cutting steps up the snow and sometimes mounting by the
        rocks. Shortly before 10 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> we arrived at a convenient place
        for a halt, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg
        233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        stopped to rest upon some rocks, immediately close to the snow, which
        commanded an excellent view of the gully.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the men were
        unpacking the food I went to a little promontory to examine our
        proposed route more narrowly, and to admire our noble couloir, which
        led straight up into the heart of the mountain for fully one thousand
        feet. It then bent towards the north, and ran up to the crest of the
        south-eastern ridge. My curiosity was piqued to know what was round
        this corner, and whilst I was gazing up at it, and following with the
        eye the exquisitely drawn curves which wandered down the snow in the
        gully, all converging to a large rut in its centre, I saw a few
        little stones skidding down. I consoled myself with thinking that
        they would not interfere with us if we adhered to the side. But then
        a larger one came down, a solitary fellow, rushing at the rate of
        sixty miles an hour—and another—and another. I was unwilling to raise
        the fears of the men unnecessarily, and said nothing to them. They
        did not hear the stones. Almer was seated on a rock, carving large
        slices from a leg of mutton, the others were chatting, and the first
        intimation they had of danger was from a crash—a sudden roar—which
        reverberated awfully amongst the cliffs, and, looking up, they saw
        masses of rocks, boulders and stones, big and little, dart round the
        corner eight hundred feet or so above us, fly with fearful fury
        against the opposite cliffs, rebound from them against the walls on
        our side, and descend; some ricochetting from side to side in a
        frantic manner; some bounding down in leaps of a hundred feet or more
        over the snow; and others trailing down in a jumbled, confused mass,
        mixed with snow and ice, deepening the grooves which, a moment
        before, had excited my admiration.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The men looked
        wildly around for protection, and, dropping the food, dashed under
        cover in all directions. The precious mutton was pitched on one side,
        the wine-bag was let fall, and its contents gushed out from the
        unclosed neck, whilst all four cowered under defending rocks,
        endeavouring to make themselves as small as possible. Let it not be
        supposed that their fright was unreason<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>able, or that I was free from it. I took good
        care to make myself safe, and went and cringed in a cleft until the
        storm had passed. But their scramble to get under shelter was
        indescribably ludicrous. Such a panic I have never witnessed, before
        or since, upon a mountain-side.<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184"
        href="#note_184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This ricochet
        practice was a novelty to me. It arose, of course, from the couloir
        being bent, and from the falling rocks having acquired great pace
        before they passed the angle. In straight gullies it will, probably,
        never be experienced. The rule is, as I have already remarked, that
        falling stones keep down the centres of gullies, and they are out of
        harm’s way if one follows the sides.</p><a name="fig66" id="fig66"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There would have
        been singularly little amusement, and very great risk, in mounting
        this gully, and we turned our backs upon it with perfect unanimity.
        The question then arose, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is to be
        done?”</span> I suggested climbing the rocks above us, but this was
        voted impossible. I thought the men were right, yet would not give in
        without being assured of the fact, and clambered up to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>settle the question. In a few minutes I
        was brought to a halt. My forces were scattered; the little hunchback
        alone was closely following me—with a broad grin upon his face, and
        the tent upon his shoulder; Croz, more behind, was still keeping an
        eye upon his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Monsieur</span></span>; Almer, a hundred feet
        below, sat on a rock with his face buried in his hands; Biener was
        nowhere, out of sight. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come down, come
        down,”</span> shouted Croz; <span class="tei tei-q">“it is
        useless,”</span> and I turned at length, convinced that it was even
        as he said. Thus my little plan was knocked on the head, and we were
        thrown back upon the original scheme.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We at once made a
        straight track for Mr. Morshead’s Breuiljoch<a id="noteref_185" name=
        "noteref_185" href="#note_185"><span class=

        was the most direct route to take in order to get to the Hörnli,
        where we intended to sleep, preparatory to attacking the eastern
        face), and arrived upon its summit at 12.30 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> We were
        then unexpectedly checked. The pass, as one, had vanished! and we
        found ourselves cut off from the Furggengletscher by a small but
        precipitous wall of rock;—the glacier had shrunk so much that descent
        was impracticable. During the last hour clouds had been coming up
        from the south; they now surrounded us, and it began to blow hard.
        The men clustered together, and advocated leaving the mountain alone.
        Almer asked, with more point than politeness, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why don’t you try to go up a mountain which <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></span> be
        ascended?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“It is impossible,”</span>
        chimed in Biener. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said Croz,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“if we cross to the other side we shall lose
        three days, and very likely shall not succeed. You want to make
        ascents in the chain of Mont Blanc, and I believe they can be made.
        But I shall not be able to make them with you if I spend these days
        here, for I must be at Chamounix on the 27th.”</span> There was force
        in what he said, and his words made me hesitate. I relied upon his
        strong arms for some work which it was expected would be unusually
        difficult. Snow began to fall; that settled the matter, and I gave
        the word to retreat. We went back to Breil, and on to the village of
        Val Tournanche, where we slept; and the next <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>day proceeded to Chatillon, and thence up the
        Valley of Aosta to Courmayeur.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot but
        regret that the counsels of the guides prevailed. If Croz had not
        uttered his well-intentioned words, he might still have been living.
        He parted from us at Chamounix at the appointed time, but by a
        strange chance we met again at Zermatt three weeks later, and two
        days afterwards he perished before my eyes on the very mountain from
        which we turned away, at his advice, on the 21st of June.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On June 23 we
        mounted to the top of Mont Saxe, to scan the Grandes Jorasses, with
        the view of ascending it. Five thousand feet of glacier-covered
        precipices rose above us, and up all that height we tracked a way to
        our satisfaction. Three thousand feet more of glacier and
        forest-covered slopes lay beneath, and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></span>,
        there was only one point at which it was doubtful if we should find a
        path. The glaciers were shrinking, and were surrounded by bastions of
        rounded rock, far too polished to please the rough mountaineer. We
        could not track a way across them. However, at 4 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> the next
        day, under the dexterous leading of Michel Croz, we passed the
        doubtful spot. Thence it was all plain sailing, and at 1 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> we
        gained the summit. The weather was boisterous in the upper regions,
        and storm-clouds driven before the wind, and wrecked against our
        heights, enveloped us in misty spray, which danced around and fled
        away, which cut us off from the material universe, and caused us to
        be, as it were, suspended betwixt heaven and earth, seeing both
        occasionally, but seeming to belong to neither.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mists lasted
        longer than my patience, and we descended without having attained the
        object for which the ascent was made. At first we followed the little
        ridge shown upon the <a href="#fig67" class=
        "tei tei-ref">accompanying engraving</a>, leading from our summit
        towards the spectator, and then took to the head of the corridor of
        glacier on its left, which in the view is left perfectly white. The
        slopes were steep and covered with new-fallen snow, flour-like and
        evil to tread upon. On the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg
        237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>ascent we had reviled it, and had made our
        staircase with much caution, knowing full well that the disturbance
        of its base would bring down all that was above. In descending, the
        bolder spirits counselled trusting to luck and a glissade; the
        cautious ones advo<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg
        238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>cated avoiding the slopes and crossing to the
        rocks on their farther side. The advice of the latter prevailed, and
        we had half-traversed the snow, to gain the ridge, when the crust
        slipped and we went along with it. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Halt!”</span> broke from all four, unanimously. The
        axe-heads flew round as we started on this involuntary glissade. It
        was useless, they slid over the underlying ice fruitlessly.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Halt!”</span> thundered Croz, as he dashed
        his weapon in again with superhuman energy. No halt could be made,
        and we slid down slowly, but with accelerating motion, driving up
        waves of snow in front, with streams of the nasty stuff hissing all
        around. Luckily, the slope eased off at one place, the leading men
        cleverly jumped aside out of the moving snow, we others followed, and
        the young avalanche which we had started, continuing to pour down,
        fell into a yawning crevasse, and showed us where our grave would
        have been if we had remained in its company five seconds longer. The
        whole affair did not occupy half-a-minute. It was the solitary
        incident of a long day, and at nightfall we re-entered the excellent
        house kept by the courteous Bertolini, well satisfied that we had not
        met with more incidents of a similar description.<a id="noteref_186"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Freethinking
        mountaineers have been latterly in the habit of going up one side of
        an Alp and coming down the other, and calling the route a pass. In
        this confusion of ideas may be recognised the result of the looseness
        of thought which arises from the absence of technical education. The
        true believer abhors such heresies, and observes with satisfaction
        that Providence oftentimes punishes the offenders for their
        greediness by causing them to be benighted. The faithful know that
        passes must be made <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">between</span></span> mountains, and not over
        their tops. Their creed declares that between any two mountains there
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">must</span></span> be a pass, and they believe
        that the end for which big peaks were created—the office they are
        especially designed to fulfil—is to point out the way one should go.
        This is the true faith, and there is no other.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We set out upon
        the 26th of June to endeavour to add one more to the passes which are
        strictly orthodox. We hoped, rather than expected, to discover a
        quicker route from Courmayeur to Chamounix than the Col du Géant,
        which was the easiest, quickest, and most direct pass known at the
        time across the main chain of Mont Blanc.<a id="noteref_187" name=
        "noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a> The
        misgivings which I had as to the result caused us to start at the
        unusual hour of 12.40 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> At 4.30 we passed the chalets of
        Prè du Bar, and thence, for some distance, followed the track which
        we had made upon the ascent of Mont Dolent, over the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>glacier of the same name (<a href="#Pg182"
        class="tei tei-ref">p. 182</a>). At a quarter past 8 we arrived at
        the head of the glacier, and at the foot of the only steep gradient
        upon the whole of the ascent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the
        beau-ideal of a pass. There was a gap in the mountains, with a big
        peak on each side (Mount Dolent and the Aig. de Triolet). A narrow
        thread of snow led up to the lowest point between those mountains,
        and the blue sky beyond said, Directly you arrive here you will begin
        to go down. We addressed ourselves to our task, and at 10.15
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> arrived at the top of the
        pass.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Had things gone as
        they ought, within six hours more we should have been at Chamounix.
        Upon the other side we knew that there was a couloir in
        correspondence with that up which we had just come. If it had been
        filled with snow all would have been well. It turned out to be filled
        with ice. Croz, who led, passed over to the other side, and reported
        that we should get down somehow, but I knew from the sound of his axe
        how the somehow would be, and settled myself to sketch, well assured
        that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">I</span></span> should not be wanted for an hour
        to come. What I saw is shown in the <a href="#fig68" class=
        "tei tei-ref">engraving</a>. A sharp aiguille (nameless), perhaps the
        sharpest in the whole range, backed on the left by the Aig. de
        Triolet; queer blocks of (probably) protogine sticking out awkwardly
        through the snow; and a huge cornice from which big icicles depended,
        that broke away occasionally and went <span class=
        "tei tei-sic">skiddling</span> down the slope up which we had come.
        Of the Argentière side I could not see anything.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Croz was tied up
        with our good Manilla rope, and the whole 200 feet were payed out
        gradually by Almer and Biener before he ceased working. After two
        hours’ incessant toil, he was able to anchor himself to the rock on
        his right. He then untied himself, the rope was drawn in, Biener was
        attached to the end and went down to join his comrade. There was then
        room enough for me to stand by the side of Almer, and I got my first
        view of the other side. For the first and only time in my life I
        looked down a slope more than a thousand feet long, set at an angle
        of about 50°, which was a sheet of ice from top to bottom. It was
        unbroken by rock or crag, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>anything thrown down it sped away unarrested
        until the level of the Glacier d’Argentière was reached. The entire
        basin of that noble <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg
        242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class=

        href="#note_188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a> was
        spread out at our feet, and the ridge beyond, culminating in the Aig.
        d’Argentière, was seen to the greatest advantage. I confess, however,
        that I paid very little attention to the view, for there was no time
        to indulge in such luxuries. I descended the icy staircase and joined
        the others, and then we three drew in the rope tenderly as Almer came
        down. His was not an enviable position, but he descended with as much
        steadiness as if his whole life had been passed on ice-slopes of 50°.
        The process was repeated; Croz again going to the front, and availing
        himself very skilfully of the rocks which projected from the cliff on
        our right. Our 200 feet of rope again came to an end, and we again
        descended one by one. From this point we were able to clamber down by
        the rocks alone for about 300 feet. They then became sheer cliff, and
        we stopped for dinner, about 2.30 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span>, at the
        last place upon which we could sit. Four hours’ incessant work had
        brought us rather more than half-way down the gully. We were now
        approaching, although we were still high above, the schrunds at its
        base, and the guides made out, in some way unknown to me, that Nature
        had perversely placed the only snow-bridge across the topmost one
        towards the centre of the gully. It was decided to cut diagonally
        across the gully to the point where the snow-bridge was supposed to
        be. Almer and Biener undertook the work, leaving Croz and myself
        firmly planted on the rocks to pay out the rope to them as they
        advanced.</p><a name="fig68" id="fig68" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is generally
        admitted that veritable ice-slopes (understanding by ice something
        more than a crust of hard snow over soft snow) are only rarely met
        with in the Alps. They are frequently spoken of, but such as that to
        which I refer are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">very</span></span> rarely seen, and still more
        seldom traversed. It is, however, always possible that they may be
        encountered, and on this account, if for no other, it is necessary
        for men who go mountaineering to be armed with ice-axes, and with
        good ones. The form is of more importance than <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>might be supposed. Of course, if you
        intend to act as a simple amateur, and let others do the work, and
        only follow in their steps, it is not of much importance what kind of
        ice-axe you carry, so long as its head does not fall off, or
        otherwise behave itself improperly.<a id="noteref_189" name=
        "noteref_189" href="#note_189"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a> There
        is no better weapon for cutting steps in ice than a common pick-axe,
        and the form of ice-axe which is now usually employed by the best
        guides is very like a miniature pick. My own axe is copied from
        Melchior Anderegg’s. It is of wrought iron, with point and edge
        steeled. Its weight, including spiked handle, is four pounds. For
        cutting steps in ice, the pointed end of the head is almost
        exclusively employed; the adze-end is handy for polishing them up,
        but is principally used for cutting in hard snow. Apart from its
        value as a cutting weapon, it is invaluable as a grapnel. It is
        <a name="corr243" id="corr243" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">naturally</span> a
        rather awkward implement when it is not being employed for its
        legitimate purpose, and is likely to give rise to much strong
        language in crushes at railway termini, unless its head is protected
        with a leathern cap, or in some other way. Many attempts have
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244"
        id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>been made, for the sake of
        convenience, to fashion an ice-axe with a movable head, but it seems
        difficult or impossible to produce one except at the expense of
        cutting qualities, and by increasing the weight.</p><a name="fig69"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. T. S. Kennedy
        (of the firm of Fairbairn &amp; Co.), whose practical acquaintance
        with mountaineering, and with the use and manufacture of tools, makes
        his opinion particularly valuable, has contrived the best that I have
        seen; but even it seems to me to be deficient in rigidity, and not to
        be so powerful a weapon as the more common kind with the fixed head.
        The simple instrument which is shown in the annexed diagram is the
        invention of Mr. Leslie Stephen, and it answers the purposes for
        which he devised it, namely, for giving better hold upon snow and ice
        than can be obtained from the common alpenstock, and for cutting an
        occasional step. The amateur scarcely requires anything more
        imposing, but for serious ice-work a heavier weapon is
        indispensable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To persons armed
        with the proper tools, ice-slopes are not so dangerous as many places
        which appeal less to the imagination. Their ascent or descent is
        necessarily laborious (to those who do the work), and they may
        therefore be termed difficult. They <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ought</span></span> not
        to be dangerous. Yet they always seem dangerous, for one is
        profoundly convinced that if he slips he will certainly go to the
        bottom. Hence, any man, who is not a fool, takes particular care to
        preserve his balance, and, in consequence, we have the noteworthy
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245"
        id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fact that accidents have seldom
        or never taken place upon ice-slopes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same slopes
        covered with snow are much less impressive, and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></span> be
        much more dangerous. They may be less slippery, the balance may be
        more easily preserved, and if one man slips he may be stopped by his
        own personal efforts, provided the snow which over-lies the ice is
        consolidated and of a reasonable depth. But if, as is more likely to
        be the case upon an angle of 50° (or anything approaching that
        angle), there is only a thin stratum of snow which is not
        consolidated, the occurrence of a slip will most likely take the
        entire party as low as possible, and in addition to the chance of
        broken necks, there will be a strong probability that some, at least,
        will be smothered by the dislodged snow. Such accidents are far too
        common, and their occurrence, as a rule, may be traced to the want of
        caution which is induced by the apparent absence of danger.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I do not believe
        that the use of the rope, in the ordinary way, affords the least
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">real</span></span> security upon ice-slopes. Nor
        do I think that any benefit is derived from the employment of
        crampons. Mr. Kennedy was good enough to present me with a pair some
        time ago, and one of these has been engraved. They are the best
        variety I have seen of the species, but I only feel comfortable with
        them on my feet in places where they are not of the slightest use,
        that is in situations where there is no possibility of slipping, and
        would not wear them upon an ice-slope for any consideration whatever.
        All such adventitious aids are useless if you have not a good step in
        the ice to stand upon, and if you have got that, nothing more is
        wanted except a few nails in the boots.</p><a name="ill245" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almer and Biener
        got to the end of their tether; the rope no longer assured their
        safety, and they stopped work as we advanced and coiled it up.
        Shortly afterwards they struck a streak of snow <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that proved to be just above the bridge of
        which they were in search. The slope steepened, and for thirty feet
        or so we descended face to the wall, making steps by kicking with the
        toes, and thrusting the arms well into the holes above, just as if
        they had been rounds in a ladder. At this time we were crossing the
        uppermost of the schrunds. Needless to say that the snow was of an
        admirable quality; this performance would otherwise have been
        impossible. It was soon over, and we then found ourselves upon a huge
        rhomboidal mass of ice, and still separated from the Argentière
        glacier by a gigantic crevasse. The only bridge over this lower
        schrund was at its eastern end, and we were obliged to double back to
        get to it. Cutting continued for half-an-hour after it was passed,
        and it was 5.35 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> before the axes stopped work, and
        we could at last turn back and look comfortably at the formidable
        slope upon which seven hours had been spent.<a id="noteref_190" name=
        "noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Col Dolent is
        not likely to compete with the Col du Géant, and I would recommend
        any person who starts to cross it to allow himself plenty of time,
        plenty of rope, and ample guide-power. There is no difficulty
        whatever upon any part of the route, excepting upon the steep slopes
        immediately below the summit on each side. When we arrived upon the
        Glacier d’Argentière, our work was as good as over. We drove a
        straight track to the chalets of Lognan, and thence the way led over
        familiar ground. Soon after dusk we got into the high road at les
        Tines, and at 10 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> arrived at Chamounix. Our labours
        were duly rewarded. Houris brought us champagne and the other drinks
        which are reserved for the faithful, but before my share was consumed
        I fell asleep in an arm-chair. I slept soundly until daybreak, and
        then turned into bed and went to sleep again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Michel Croz now
        parted from us. His new employer had not arrived at Chamounix, but
        Croz considered that he was bound by honour to wait for him, and thus
        Christian Almer, of Grindelwald, became my leading guide.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almer displayed
        aptitude for mountaineering at an early age. Whilst still a very
        young man he was known as a crack chamois-hunter, and he soon
        developed into an accomplished guide. Those who have read Mr. Wills’
        graphic account of the first ascent of the Wetterhorn<a id=
        "noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a> will
        remember that, when his party was approaching the top of the
        mountain, two stranger men were seen climbing by a slightly different
        route, one of whom carried upon his back a young fir-tree, branches,
        leaves, and all. Mr. Wills’ guides were extremely indignant with
        these two strangers (who were evidently determined to be the first at
        the summit), and talked of giving them blows. Eventually they gave
        them a cake of chocolate instead, and declared that they were good
        fellows. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus the pipe of peace was smoked,
        and tranquillity reigned between the rival forces.”</span> Christian
        Almer was one of these two men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was in 1854.
        In 1858-9 he made the first ascents of the Eigher and the Mönch, the
        former with a Mr. Harrington (?), and the latter with Dr. Porges.
        Since then he has wandered far and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        the exception of Melchior Anderegg, there is not, perhaps, another
        guide of such wide experience, or one who has been so invariably
        successful; and his numerous employers concur in saying that there is
        not a truer heart or a surer foot to be found amongst the
        Alps.</p><a name="fig73" id="fig73" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before recrossing
        the chain to Courmayeur, we ascended the Aiguille Verte. In company
        with Mr. Reilly I inspected this mountain from every direction in
        1864, and came to the conclusion that an ascent could more easily be
        made from the south than upon any other side. We set out upon the
        28th from Chamounix to attack it, minus Croz, and plus a porter (of
        whom I will speak more particularly presently), leaving our comrade
        very downcast at having to kick his heels in idleness, whilst we were
        about to scale the most celebrated of his native Aiguilles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our course led us
        over the old Mer de Glace—the glacier made famous by De Saussure and
        Forbes. The heat of the day was <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>over, but the little rills and rivulets were
        still flowing along the surface of the ice: cutting deep troughs
        where the gradients were small; leaving ripple-marks where the water
        was with more difficulty confined to one channel; and falling over
        the precipitous walls of the great crevasses, sometimes in bounding
        cascades, and sometimes in diffused streams, which marked the
        perpendicular faces with graceful sinuosities.<a id="noteref_194"

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a> As
        night came on, their music died away, the rivulets dwindled down to
        rills; the rills ceased to murmur, and the sparkling drops, caught by
        the hand of frost, were bound to the ice, coating it with an
        enamelled film which lasted until the sun struck the glacier once
        more.</p><a name="fig74" id="fig74" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We camped on the
        Couvercle (7800) under a great rock, and at 3.15 the next morning
        started for our aiguille, leaving the porter in charge of the tent
        and of the food. Two hours’ walking over crisp snow brought us up
        more than 4000 feet, and within about 1600 feet of the summit. From
        no other direction can it be approached so closely with equal
        facility. Thence the mountain steepens. After his late severe piece
        of ice-work, Almer had a natural inclination for rocks; but the lower
        rocks of the final peak of the Verte were not inviting, and he went
        on and on, looking for a way up them, until we arrived in front of a
        great snow couloir that led from the Glacier de Talèfre right up to
        the crest of the ridge connecting the summit of the Verte with the
        mountain called Les Droites. This was the route which I intended to
        be taken; but Almer pointed out that the gully narrowed at the lower
        part, and that, if stones fell, we should stand some chance of
        getting our heads broken; and so we went on still more to the east of
        the summit, to another and smaller couloir which ran up side by side
        with the great one. At 5.30 we crossed the schrund which protected
        the final peak, and, a few minutes afterwards, saw the summit and the
        whole of the intervening route. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh! Aiguille
        Verte,”</span> said my guide, stopping as he said it, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“you are dead, you are dead;”</span> which, being
        translated into plain English, meant that he was cock-sure we should
        make its ascent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almer is a quiet
        man at all times. When climbing he is taciturn—and this is one of his
        great merits. A garrulous man is always a nuisance, and upon the
        mountain-side he may be a danger, for actual climbing requires a
        man’s whole attention. Added to this, talkative men are hindrances;
        they are usually thirsty, and a thirsty man is a drag.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Guide-books
        recommend mountain-walkers to suck pebbles, to prevent their throats
        from becoming parched. There is not much goodness to be got out of
        the pebbles; but you cannot suck them and keep the mouth open at the
        same time, and hence the throat does not become dry. It answers just
        as well to keep the mouth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg
        251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>shut, without any pebbles inside,—indeed, I
        think, better; for if you have occasion to open your mouth, you can
        do so without swallowing any pebbles.<a id="noteref_195" name=
        "noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> As a
        rule, amateurs, and particularly novices, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">will not</span></span>
        keep their mouths shut. They attempt to <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“force the pace,”</span> they go faster than they can go
        without being compelled to open their mouths to breathe, they pant,
        their throats and tongues become parched, they drink and perspire
        copiously, and, becoming exhausted, declare that the dryness of the
        air, or the rarefaction of the air (everything is laid upon the air),
        is in fault. On several accounts, therefore, a mountain-climber does
        well to hold his tongue when he is at his work.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the top of the
        small gully we crossed over the intervening rocks into the large one,
        and followed it so long as it was filled with snow. At last ice
        replaced snow, and we turned over to the rocks upon its left.
        Charming rocks they were; granitic in texture,<a id="noteref_196"
        name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a> gritty,
        holding the nails well. At 9.45 we parted from them, and completed
        the ascent by a little ridge of snow which descended in the direction
        of the Aiguille du Moine. At 10.15 we stood on the summit (13,540),
        and devoured our bread and cheese with a good appetite.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have already
        spoken of the disappointing nature of purely panoramic views. That
        seen from Mont Blanc itself is notoriously unsatisfactory. When you
        are upon that summit you look down upon all the rest of Europe. There
        is nothing to look up to; all is below; there is no one point for the
        eye to rest upon. The man who is there is somewhat in the position of
        one who has attained all that he desires,—he has nothing to aspire
        to; his position must needs be unsatisfactory. Upon the summit of the
        Verte there is not this objection. You see valleys, villages, fields;
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252"
        id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>you see mountains interminable
        rolling away, lakes resting in their hollows; you hear the tinkling
        of the sheep-bells as it rises through the clear mountain air, and
        the roar of the avalanches as they descend to the valleys: but above
        all there is the great white dome, with its shining crest high above;
        with its sparkling glaciers that descend between buttresses which
        support them: with its brilliant snows, purer and yet purer the
        farther they are removed from this unclean world.<a id="noteref_197"
        name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even upon this
        mountain-top it was impossible to forget the world, for some vile
        wretch came to the Jardin and made hideous sounds by blowing through
        a horn. Whilst we were denouncing him a change came over the weather;
        cumulous clouds gathered in all directions, and we started off in hot
        haste. Snow began to fall heavily before we were off the
        summit-rocks, our track was obscured and frequently lost, and
        everything became so sloppy and slippery that the descent took as
        long as the ascent. The schrund was recrossed at 3.15 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span>, and
        thence we raced down to the Couvercle, intending to have a carouse
        there; but as we rounded our rock a howl broke simultaneously from
        all three of us, for the porter had taken down the tent, and was in
        the act of moving off with it. <span class="tei tei-q">“Stop, there!
        what are you doing?”</span> He observed that he had thought we were
        killed, or at least lost, and was going to Chamounix to communicate
        his ideas to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">guide chef</span></span>. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Unfasten the tent, and get out the food.”</span> Instead
        of doing so the porter fumbled in his pockets. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Get out the food,”</span> we roared, losing all
        patience. <span class="tei tei-q">“Here it is,”</span> said our
        worthy friend, producing a dirty piece of bread about as big as a
        halfpenny roll. We three looked solemnly at the fluff-covered morsel.
        It was past a joke,—he had devoured everything. Mutton, loaves,
        cheese, wine, eggs, sausages—all was gone—past recovery. It was idle
        to grumble, and useless to wait. We were light, and could move
        quickly,—the porter was laden <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>inside and out. We went our hardest,—he had to
        shuffle and trot. He streamed with perspiration; the mutton and
        cheese oozed out in big drops,—he larded the glacier. We had our
        revenge, and dried our clothes at the same time, but when we arrived
        at the Montanvert the porter was as wet as we had been upon our
        arrival at the Couvercle. We halted at the inn to get a little food,
        and at a quarter past eight re-entered Chamounix, amidst firing of
        cannon and other demonstrations of satisfaction on the part of the
        hotel-keepers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One would have
        thought that the ascent of this mountain, which had been frequently
        assailed before without success, would have afforded some
        gratification to a population whose chief support is derived from
        tourists, and that the prospect of the perennial flow of francs which
        might be expected to result from it would have stifled the jealousy
        consequent on the success of foreigners.<a id="noteref_198" name=
        "noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not so.
        Chamounix stood on its rights. A stranger had ignored the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“regulations,”</span> had imported two
        foreign guides, and, furthermore, he had added injury to that
        insult—he had not taken a single Chamounix guide. Chamounix would be
        revenged! It would bully the foreign guides; it would tell them they
        had lied,—that they had not made the ascent! Where were their proofs?
        Where was the flag upon the summit?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Poor Almer and
        Biener were accordingly chivied from pillar to post, from one inn to
        another, and at length complained to me. Peter Perrn, the Zermatt
        guide, said on the night that we returned that this was to happen,
        but the story seemed too absurd to be true. I now bade my men go out
        again, and followed them myself to see the sport. Chamounix was
        greatly excited. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bureau</span></span> of the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">guide
        chef</span></span> was thronged with clamouring men. Their
        ringleader—one Zacharie Cachat—a well-known guide, of no particular
        merit, but not a bad fellow, was haranguing the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>multitude. He met with more than his
        match. My friend Kennedy, who was on the spot, heard of the
        disturbance and rushed into the fray, confronted the burly guide, and
        thrust back his absurdities into his teeth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were the
        materials for a very pretty riot; but they manage these things better
        in France than we do, and the gensdarmes—three strong—came down and
        dispersed the crowd. The guides quailed before the cocked hats, and
        retired to cabarets to take little glasses of absinthe and other
        liquors more or less injurious to the human frame. Under the
        influence of these stimulants, they conceived an idea which combined
        revenge with profit. <span class="tei tei-q">“You have ascended the
        Aiguille Verte, you say. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">We</span></span> say we don’t believe it.
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">We</span></span> say, do it again! Take three of
        us with you, and we will bet you two thousand francs to one thousand,
        that you won’t make the ascent!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This proposition
        was formally notified to me, but I declined it, with thanks, and
        recommended Kennedy to go in and win. I accepted, however, a hundred
        franc share in the bet, and calculated upon getting two hundred per
        cent on my investment. Alas! how vain are human expectations!
        Zacharie Cachat was put into confinement, and although Kennedy
        actually ascended the Aiguille a week later, with two Chamounix
        guides and Peter Perrn, the bet came to nothing.<a id="noteref_199"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The person who
        discovered the Col du Géant must have been a shrewd mountaineer. The
        pass was in use before any other was known across the main chain of
        Mont Blanc, and down to the present time it remains the easiest and
        quickest route from Chamounix to Courmayeur, with the single
        exception of the pass that we crossed upon the 3d of July, for the
        first time, which lies about mid-way between the Aiguille de Triolet
        and the Aiguille de Talèfre, and which, for want of a better name, I
        have called the Col de Talèfre.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When one looks
        toward the upper end of the Glacier de Talèfre from the direction of
        the Jardin or of the Couvercle, the ridge that bounds the view seems
        to be of little elevation. It is overpowered by the colossal Grandes
        Jorasses, and by the almost equally magnificent Aiguille Verte. The
        ridge, notwithstanding, is by no means despicable. At no point is its
        elevation less than 11,600 feet. It <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>does not look anything like this height. The
        Glacier de Talèfre mounts with a steady incline, and the eye is
        completely deceived.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1864, when
        prowling about with Mr. Reilly, I instinctively fixed upon a bent
        couloir which led up from the glacier to the lowest part of the
        ridge; and when, after crossing the Col de Triolet, I saw that the
        other side presented no particular difficulty, it seemed to me that
        this was the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">one</span></span> point in the whole of the
        range which would afford an easier passage than the Col du Géant.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We set out from
        the Montanvert at 4 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> upon July 3, to see whether this
        opinion was correct, and it fortunately happened that the Rev. A. G.
        Girdlestone and a friend, with two Chamounix guides, left the inn at
        the same hour as ourselves, to cross the Col du Géant. We kept in
        company as far as our routes lay together, and at 9.35 we arrived at
        the top of our pass, having taken the route to the south of the
        Jardin. Description is unnecessary, as our track is laid down very
        clearly on the <a href="#fig75" class="tei tei-ref">engraving</a> at
        the head of this chapter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Much snow had
        fallen during the late bad weather, and as we reposed upon the top of
        our pass (which was about 11,650 feet above the level of the sea, and
        600 feet above the Col du Géant), we saw that the descent of the
        rocks which intervened between us and the Glacier de Triolet would
        require some caution, for the sun’s rays poured down directly upon
        them, and the snow slipped away every now and then from ledge to
        ledge just as if it had been water,—in cascades not large enough to
        be imposing, but sufficient to knock us over if we got in their way.
        This little bit of cliff consequently took a longer time than it
        should have done, for when we heard the indescribable swishing,
        hissing sound which announced a coming fall, we of necessity huddled
        under the lee of the rocks until the snow ceased to shoot over
        us.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We got to the
        level of the Glacier de Triolet without misadventure, then steered
        for its left bank to avoid the upper of its two formidable ice-falls,
        and after descending the requisite distance by some old snow lying
        between the glacier and the cliffs which border <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it, crossed directly to the right bank
        over the level ice between the two ice-falls.<a id="noteref_200"
        name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> The
        right bank was gained without any trouble, and we found there
        numerous beds of hard snow (avalanche débris) down which we could run
        or glissade as fast as we liked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Glissading is a
        very pleasant employment when it is accomplished successfully, and I
        have never seen a place where it can be more safely indulged in than
        the snowy valley on the right bank of the Glacier de Triolet. In my
        dreams I glissade delightfully, but in practice I find that somehow
        the snow will not behave properly, and that my alpenstock
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">will</span></span> get between my legs. Then my
        legs go where my head should be, and I see the sky revolving at a
        rapid pace; the snow rises up and smites me, and runs away; and when
        it is at last overtaken it suddenly stops, and we come into violent
        collision. Those who are with me say that I tumble head over heels,
        and there may be some truth in what they say. Streaks of ice are apt
        to make the heels shoot away, and stray stones cause one to pitch
        headlong down. Somehow these things always seem to come in the way,
        so it is as well to glissade only when there is something soft to
        tumble into.<a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Near the
        termination of the glacier we could not avoid traversing a portion of
        its abominable moraine, but at 1.30 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> we were
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258"
        id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>clear of it, and threw
        ourselves upon some springy turf conscious that our day’s work was
        over. An hour afterwards we resumed the march, crossed the Doire
        torrent by a bridge a little below Gruetta, and at five o’clock
        entered Courmayeur, having occupied somewhat less than ten hours on
        the way. Mr. Girdlestone’s party came in, I believe, about four hours
        afterwards, so there was no doubt that we made a shorter pass than
        the Col du Géant; and I believe we discovered a quicker way of
        getting from Chamounix to Courmayeur, or <span class=

        with the exception of the ascent of the Matterhorn, and we now turned
        our faces in its direction, but instead of returning <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viâ</span></span> the
        Val Tournanche, we took a route across country, and bagged upon our
        way the summit of the Ruinette.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We passed the
        night of July 4, at Aosta, under the roof of the genial Tairraz, and
        on the 5th went by the Val d’Ollomont and the Col de la Fenêtre
        (9140) to Chermontane. We slept that night at the chalets of Chanrion
        (a foul spot, which should be avoided), left them at 3.50 the next
        morning, and after a short scramble over the slope above, and a
        half-mile tramp on the glacier de Breney, we crossed directly to the
        Ruinette, and went almost straight up it. There is not, I suppose,
        another mountain in the Alps of the same height that can be ascended
        so easily. You have only to go ahead: upon its southern side one can
        walk about almost anywhere.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though I speak
        thus slightingly of a very respectable peak, I will not do anything
        of the kind in regard to the view which it gives. It is happily
        placed in respect to the rest of the Pennine Alps, and as a
        stand-point it has not many superiors. You see mountains, and nothing
        but mountains. It is a solemn—some would say a dreary—view, but it is
        very grand. The great Combin (14,164), with its noble background of
        the whole range of Mont <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
        260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Blanc, never looks so big as it does from here.
        In the contrary direction, the Matterhorn overpowers all besides. The
        Dent d’Hérens, although closer, looks a mere outlier of its great
        neighbour, and the snows of Monte Rosa, behind, seem intended for no
        other purpose than to give relief to the crags in front. To the south
        there is an endless array of Bec’s and Becca’s, backed by the great
        Italian peaks, whilst to the north Mont Pleureur (12,159) holds it
        own against the more distant Wildstrubel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We gained the
        summit at 9.15,<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href=
        "#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a> and
        stayed there an hour and a half. My faithful guides then admonished
        me that Prerayen, whither we were bound, was still far away, and that
        we had yet to cross two lofty ridges. So we resumed our harness and
        departed; not, however, before a huge cairn had been built out of the
        blocks of gneiss with which the summit is bestrewn. Then we trotted
        down the slopes of the Ruinette, over the glacier de Breney, and
        across a pass which (if it deserves a name) may be called the Col des
        Portons, after the neighbouring peaks. Thence we proceeded across the
        great Otemma glacier towards the Col d’Olen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The part of the
        glacier that we traversed was overspread with snow which completely
        concealed its numerous pitfalls. We marched across it in single file,
        and, of course, roped together. All at once Almer dropped into a
        crevasse up to his shoulders. I pulled in the rope immediately, but
        the snow gave way as it was being done, and I had to spread out my
        arms to stop my descent. Biener held fast, and said afterwards, that
        his feet went through as well; so, for a moment, all three were in
        the jaws of the crevasse. We now altered our course, so as to take
        the fissures transversely, and changed it again after the centre of
        the glacier was passed, and made directly for the summit of the Col
        d’Olen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is scarcely
        necessary to observe, after what I have said <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>before, that it is my invariable practice to
        employ a rope when traversing a snow-covered glacier. Many guides,
        even the best ones, object to be roped, more especially early in the
        morning, when the snow is hard. They object sometimes, because they
        think it is unnecessary. Crevasses that are bridged by snow are
        almost always more or less perceptible by undulations on the surface;
        the snow droops down, and hollows mark the courses of the chasms
        beneath. An experienced guide usually notices these almost
        imperceptible wrinkles, steps one side or the other, as the case may
        require, and rarely breaks through unawares. Guides think there is no
        occasion to employ a rope because they think that they will not be
        taken by surprise. Michel Croz used to be of this opinion. He used to
        say that only imbeciles and children required to be tied up in the
        morning. I told him that in this particular matter I was a child to
        him. <span class="tei tei-q">“You see these things, my good Croz, and
        avoid them. I do <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></span>, except you point them out to
        me, and so that which is not a danger to you, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span> a
        danger to me.”</span> The sharper one’s eyes get by use, the less is
        a rope required as a protective against these hidden pitfalls; but,
        according to my experience, the sight never becomes so keen that they
        can be avoided with unvarying certainty, and I mentioned what
        occurred upon the Otemma glacier to show that this is so.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I well remember my
        first passage of the Col Théodule—the easiest of the higher Alpine
        glacier passes. We had a rope, but my guide said it was not
        necessary, he knew all the crevasses. However, we did not go a
        quarter of a mile before he dropped through the snow into a crevasse
        up to his neck. He was a heavy man, and would scarcely have
        extricated himself alone; anyhow, he was very glad of my assistance.
        When he got on to his legs again, he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, I had no idea that there was a crevasse
        there!”</span> He no longer objected to use the rope, and we
        proceeded; upon my part, with greater peace of mind than before. I
        have crossed the pass fourteen times since then, and have invariably
        insisted upon being tied together.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Guides object to
        the use of the rope upon snow-covered glacier, because they are
        afraid of being laughed at by their comrades; and this, perhaps, is
        the more common reason. To illustrate this, here is another Théodule
        experience. We arrived at the edge of the ice, and I required to be
        tied. My guide (a Zermatt man of repute) said that no one used a rope
        going across that pass. I declined to argue the matter, and we put on
        the rope; though very much against the wish of my man, who protested
        that he should have to submit to perpetual ridicule if we met any of
        his acquaintances. We had not gone very far before we saw a train
        coming in the contrary direction. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> cried my man, <span class="tei tei-q">“there
        is R—— (mentioning a guide who used to be kept at the Riffel Hotel
        for the ascent of Monte Rosa); it will be as I said, I shall never
        hear the end of this.”</span> The guide we met was followed by a
        string of tom-fools, none of whom were tied together, and had his
        face covered by a mask to prevent it becoming blistered. After we had
        passed, I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, should R—— make any
        observations to you, ask him why he takes such extraordinary care to
        preserve the skin of his face, which will grow again in a week, when
        he neglects such an obvious precaution in regard to his life, which
        he can only lose once.”</span> This was quite a new idea to my guide,
        and he said nothing more against the use of the rope so long as we
        were together.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I believe that the
        unwillingness to use a rope upon snow-covered glacier which born
        mountaineers not unfrequently exhibit, arises—First, on the part of
        expert men, from the consciousness that they themselves incur little
        risk; secondly, on the part of inferior men, from fear of ridicule,
        and from aping the ways of their superiors; and, thirdly, from pure
        ignorance or laziness. Whatever may be the reason, I raise up my
        voice against the neglect of a precaution so simple and so effectual.
        In my opinion, the very first thing a glacier traveller requires is
        plenty of good rope.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A committee of the
        English Alpine Club was appointed in 1864 to test, and to report
        upon, the most suitable ropes for <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>mountaineering purposes, and those which were
        approved are probably as good as can be found. One is made of Manilla
        and another of Italian hemp. The former is the heavier, and weighs a
        little more than an ounce per foot (103 ozs. to 100 feet). The latter
        weighs 79 ozs. per 100 feet; but I prefer the Manilla rope, because
        it is more handy to handle. Both of these ropes will sustain 168 lbs.
        falling 10 feet, or 196 lbs. falling 8 feet, and they break with a
        dead weight of two tons.<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href=
        "#note_204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a> In 1865
        we carried two 100 feet lengths of the Manilla rope, and the
        inconvenience arising from its weight was more than made up for by
        the security which it afforded. Upon several occasions it was worth
        more than an extra guide.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, touching the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">use</span></span> of the rope. There is a right
        way, and there are wrong ways of using it. I often meet, upon
        glacier-passes, elegantly got-up persons, who are clearly out of
        their element, with a guide stalking along in front, who pays no
        attention to the innocents in his charge. They are tied together as a
        matter of form, but they evidently have no idea <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></span> they
        are tied up, for they walk side by side, or close together, with the
        rope trailing on the snow. If one tumbles into a crevasse, the rest
        stare, and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“La! what is the matter with
        Smith?”</span> unless, as is more likely, they all tumble in
        together. This is the wrong way to use a rope. It is abuse of the
        rope.</p><a name="ill263" id="ill263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is of the first
        importance to keep the rope taut from man to man. If this is not
        done, there is no real security, and your risks may be considerably
        magnified. There is little or no difficulty in extricating one man
        who breaks through a bridged crevasse if the <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>rope is taut; but the case may be very awkward
        if two break through at the same moment, close together, and there
        are only two others to aid, or perhaps only one other. Further, the
        rope ought not upon any account to graze over snow, ice, or rocks,
        otherwise the strands suffer, and the lives of the whole party may be
        endangered. Apart from this, it is extremely annoying to have a rope
        knocking about one’s heels. If circumstances render it impossible for
        the rope to be kept taut by itself, the men behind should gather it
        up round their hands,<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href=
        "#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a> and not
        allow it to incommode those in advance. A man must either be
        incompetent, careless, or selfish, if he permits the rope to dangle
        about the heels of the person in front of him.</p><a name="fig78" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The distance from
        man to man must neither be too great nor too small. About 12 feet
        between each is sufficient. If there are only two or three persons,
        it is prudent to allow a little more—say 15 feet. More than this is
        unnecessary, and less than 9 or 10 feet is not much good.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is essential to
        examine your rope from time to time to see that it is in good
        condition. If you are wise you will do this yourself every day.
        Latterly, I have examined every inch of my rope overnight, and upon
        more than one occasion have found the strands of the Manilla rope
        nearly half severed through accidental grazes.</p><span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far the rope
        has been supposed to be employed upon level, snow-covered glacier, to
        prevent any risk from concealed crevasses. On rocks and on slopes it
        is used for a different purpose (namely, to guard against slips), and
        in these cases it is equally important to keep it taut, and to
        preserve a reasonable distance one from the other. It is much more
        troublesome to keep the rope taut upon slopes than upon the level;
        and upon difficult rocks it is all but impossible, except by adopting
        the plan of moving only one at a time (see p. 115).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no good
        reason for employing a rope upon easy rocks, and I believe that its
        needless use is likely to promote carelessness. On difficult rocks
        and on snow-slopes (frequently improperly called ice-slopes) it is a
        great advantage to be tied together, provided the rope is handled
        properly; but upon actual ice-slopes, such as that on the Col Dolent
        (<a href="#Pg240" class="tei tei-ref">p. 240</a>), or upon slopes in
        which ice is mingled with small and loose rocks, such as the upper
        part of the Pointe des Ecrins, it is almost useless, because a slip
        made by one person might upset the entire party.<a id="noteref_206"
        name="noteref_206" href="#note_206"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a> I am
        not prepared to say, however, that men should not be tied together
        upon similar slopes. Being attached to others usually gives
        confidence, and confidence decidedly assists stability. It is more
        questionable whether men should be in such places at all. If a man
        can keep on his feet upon an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">escalier</span></span> cut in an ice-slope, I
        see no reason why he should be <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>debarred from making use of that particular form
        of staircase. If he cannot, let him keep clear of such places.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There would be no
        advantage in discoursing upon the use of the rope at greater length.
        A single day upon a mountain’s side will give a clearer idea of the
        value of a good rope, and of the numerous purposes for which it may
        be employed, than any one will obtain from reading all that has been
        written upon the subject; but no one will become really expert in its
        management without much experience.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the Col
        d’Olen we proceeded down the Combe of the same name to the chalets of
        Prerayen, and passed the night of the 6th under the roof of our old
        acquaintance, the wealthy herdsman. On the 7th we crossed the Va
        Cornère pass, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        were fixed on the Matterhorn, and my guides knew that I wished them
        to accompany me. They had an aversion to the mountain, and repeatedly
        expressed their belief that it was useless to try to ascend it.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        the Matterhorn should be abandoned. Both men spoke fairly enough.
        They did not think that an ascent could be made; and for their own
        credit, as well as for my sake, they did not wish to undertake a
        business which, in their opinion, would only lead to loss of time and
        money.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I sent them by the
        short cut to Breil, and walked down to Val Tournanche to look for
        Jean-Antoine Carrel. He was not there. The villagers said that he,
        and three others, had started on the 6th to try the Matterhorn by the
        old way, on their own account. They will have no luck, I thought, for
        the clouds were low down on the mountains; and I walked up to Breil,
        fully expecting to meet them. Nor was I disappointed. About half-way
        up I saw a group of men clustered around a chalet upon the other side
        of the torrent, and, crossing over, found that the party had
        returned. Jean-Antoine and Cæsar were there, C. E. Gorret, and J. J.
        Maquignaz. They had had no success. The weather, they said, had been
        horrible, and they had scarcely reached the glacier du Lion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I explained the

        face. He was unwilling to abandon the old route, and urged me to try
        it again. I promised to do so provided the new route failed. This
        satisfied him, and he agreed to my proposal. I then went up to Breil,
        and discharged Almer and Biener—with much regret, for no two men ever

        the morning of Sunday the 9th I went down the valley to look after
        the sick man. On my way I passed a foreign gentleman, with a mule and
        several porters laden with baggage. Amongst these men were
        Jean-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name=

        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“what are you doing?”</span> They
        explained that the foreigner had arrived just as they were setting
        out, and that they were assisting his porters. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Very well; go on to Breil, and await me there; we start
        at midnight as agreed.”</span> Jean-Antoine then said that he should
        not be able to serve me after Tuesday the 11th, as he was engaged to
        travel <span class="tei tei-q">“with a family of distinction”</span>
        in the valley of Aosta. <span class="tei tei-q">“And Cæsar?”</span>

        not object to the answer; but the prospect of being left guideless
        was provoking. They went up, and I down, the valley.</p>

        declared that he was better, though the exertion of saying as much

        want of medicine, and I tramped down to Chatillon to get it. It was
        late before I returned to Val Tournanche, for the weather was
        tempestuous, and rain fell in torrents. A figure passed me under the

        cross the Théodule, on account of the continued storms. The inn was
        lonely. I went to bed early, and was awoke the next morning by the

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why,”</span> said he, <span class=

        I saw in a moment that I had been bamboozled and humbugged; and
        learned, bit by bit, that the affair had been arranged long
        beforehand. The start on the 6th had been for a preliminary
        reconnaissance; the mule, that I passed, was conveying stores for the
        attack; the <span class="tei tei-q">“family of distinction”</span>
        was Signor F. Giordano, who had just despatched the party to
        facilitate the way to the summit, and who, when the facilitation was
        completed, was to be taken to the top along with Signor Sella!<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was greatly
        mortified. My plans were upset; the Italians had clearly stolen a
        march upon me, and I saw that the astute Favre chuckled over my
        discomfiture, because the route by the eastern face, if successful,
        would not benefit his inn. What was to be done? I retired to my room,
        and soothed by tobacco, re-studied my plans, to see if it was not
        possible to outmanœuvre the Italians.</p>

        Altogether, I reckoned that they could not possibly ascend the
        mountain and come back to Breil in less than seven days. I got
        cooler, for it was evident that the wily ones might be outwitted
        after all. There was time enough to go to Zermatt, to try the eastern
        face, and, should it prove impracticable, to come back to Breil
        before the men returned; and then, it seemed to me, as the mountain
        was not padlocked, one might start at the same time as the Messieurs,
        and yet get to the top before them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first thing to
        do was to go to Zermatt. Easier said than done. The seven guides upon
        the mountain included the ablest men in the valley, and none of the
        ordinary muleteer-guides were at Breil. Two men, at least, were
        wanted for my baggage, but not a soul could be found. I ran about,
        and sent about in all directions, but not a single porter could be
        obtained. One was with Carrel; another was ill; another was at
        Chatillon, and so forth. Even Meynet, the hunchback, could not be
        induced to come; he was in the thick of some important cheese-making
        operations. I was in the position of a general without an army; it
        was all very well to make plans, but there was no one to execute
        them. This did not much trouble me, for it was evident that so long
        as the weather stopped traffic over the Théodule pass, it would
        hinder the men equally upon the Matterhorn; and I knew that directly
        it improved company would certainly arrive.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About midday on
        Tuesday the 11th a large party hove in sight from Zermatt, preceded
        by a nimble young Englishman, and one of old Peter Taugwalder’s
        sons.<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href=
        "#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a> I went
        at once to this gentleman to learn if he could dispense with
        Taugwalder. He said that he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg
        271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>could not, as they were going to recross to
        Zermatt on the morrow, but that the young man should assist in
        transporting my baggage, as he had nothing to carry. We naturally got
        into conversation. I told my story, and learned that the young
        Englishman was Lord Francis Douglas,<a id="noteref_213" name=
        "noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a> whose
        recent exploit—the ascent of the Gabelhorn—had excited my wonder and
        admiration. He brought good news. Old Peter had lately been beyond
        the Hörnli, and had reported that he thought an ascent of the
        Matterhorn was possible upon that side. Almer had left Zermatt, and
        could not be recovered, so I determined to seek for old Peter. Lord
        Francis Douglas expressed a warm desire to ascend the mountain, and
        before long it was determined that he should take part in the
        expedition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Favre could no
        longer hinder our departure, and lent us one of his men. We crossed
        the Col Théodule on Wednesday morning the 12th of July, rounded the
        foot of the Ober Théodulgletscher, crossed the Furggengletscher, and
        deposited tent, blankets, ropes, and other matters in the little
        chapel at the Schwarzsee.<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href=
        "#note_214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a> All
        four were heavily laden, for we brought across the whole of my stores
        from Breil. Of rope alone there was about 600 feet. There were three
        kinds. First, 200 feet of the Manilla rope; second, 150 feet of a
        stouter, and probably stronger rope than the first; and third, more
        than 200 feet of a lighter and weaker rope than the first, of a kind
        that I used formerly (stout sash-line).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We descended to
        Zermatt, sought and engaged old Peter, and gave him permission to
        choose another guide. When we returned to the Monte Rosa Hotel, whom
        should we see sitting upon the wall in front but my old <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">guide
        chef</span></span>, Michel Croz. I supposed that he had come with Mr.
        B——, but I learned that that gentleman had arrived in ill health, at
        Chamounix, and had returned to England. Croz, thus left free, had
        been immediately engaged by the Rev. Charles Hudson, and they had
        come to Zermatt with the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg
        272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>same
        object as ourselves—namely, to attempt the ascent of the
        Matterhorn!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lord Francis
        Douglas and I dined at the Monte Rosa, and had just finished when Mr.
        Hudson and a friend entered the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">salle à manger</span></span>. They had returned
        from inspecting the mountain, and some idlers in the room demanded
        their intentions. We heard a confirmation of Croz’s statement, and
        learned that Mr. Hudson intended to set out on the morrow at the same
        hour as ourselves. We left the room to consult, and agreed it was
        undesirable that two independent parties should be on the mountain at
        the same time with the same object. Mr. Hudson was therefore invited
        to join us, and he accepted our proposal. Before admitting his
        friend—Mr. Hadow—I took the precaution to inquire what he had done in
        the Alps, and, as well as I remember, Mr. Hudson’s reply was,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Hadow has done Mont Blanc in less time
        than most men.”</span> He then mentioned several other excursions
        that were unknown to me, and added, in answer to a further question,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I consider he is a sufficiently good man to
        go with us.”</span> Mr. Hadow was admitted without any further
        question, and we then went into the matter of guides. Hudson thought
        that Croz and old Peter would be sufficient. The question was
        referred to the men themselves, and they made no objection.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So Croz and I
        became comrades once more; and as I threw myself on my bed and tried
        to go to sleep, I wondered at the strange series of chances which had
        first separated us and then brought us together again. I thought of
        the mistake through which he had accepted the engagement to Mr. B——;
        of his unwillingness to adopt my route; of his recommendation to
        transfer our energies to the chain of Mont Blanc; of the retirement
        of Almer and Biener; of the desertion of Carrel; of the arrival of
        Lord Francis Douglas; and, lastly, of our meeting at Zermatt; and as
        I pondered over these things I could not help asking, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What next?”</span> If any one of the links of this fatal
        chain of circumstances had been omitted, what a different story I
        should have to tell!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We started from
        Zermatt on the 13th of July, at half-past 5, on a brilliant and
        perfectly cloudless morning. We were eight in number—Croz, old Peter
        and his two sons,<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href=
        "#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a> and I.
        To ensure steady motion, one tourist <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>and one native walked together. The youngest
        Taugwalder fell to my share, and the lad marched well, proud to be on
        the expedition, and happy to show his powers. The wine-bags also fell
        to my lot to carry, and throughout the day, after each drink, I
        replenished them secretly with water, so that at the next halt they
        were found fuller than before! This was considered a good omen, and
        little short of miraculous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the first day
        we did not intend to ascend to any great height, and we mounted,
        accordingly, very leisurely; picked up the things which were left in
        the chapel at the Schwarzsee at 8.20, and proceeded thence along the
        ridge connecting the Hörnli with the Matterhorn.<a id="noteref_217"
        name="noteref_217" href="#note_217"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a> At
        half-past 11 we arrived at the base of the actual peak; then quitted
        the ridge, and clambered round <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>some ledges, on to the eastern face. We were now
        fairly upon the mountain, and were astonished to find that places
        which from the Riffel, or even from the Furggengletscher, looked
        entirely impracticable, were so easy that we could <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">run
        about</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before twelve
        o’clock we had found a good position for the tent, at a height of
        11,000 feet.<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href=
        "#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a> Croz
        and young Peter went on to see what was above, in order to save time
        on the following morning. They cut across the heads of the
        snow-slopes which descended towards the Furggengletscher, and
        disappeared round a corner; and shortly afterwards we saw them high
        up on the face, moving quickly. We others made a solid platform for
        the tent in a well-protected spot, and then watched eagerly for the
        return of the men. The stones which they upset told that they were
        very high, and we supposed that the way must be easy. At length, just
        before 3 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span>, we saw them coming down,
        evidently much excited. <span class="tei tei-q">“What are they
        saying, Peter?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Gentlemen, they say
        it is no good.”</span> But when they came near we heard a different
        story. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing but what was good; not a
        difficulty, not a single difficulty! We could have gone to the summit
        and returned to-day easily!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We passed the
        remaining hours of daylight—some basking in the sunshine, some
        sketching or collecting; and when the sun went down, giving, as it
        departed, a glorious promise for the morrow, we returned to the tent
        to arrange for the night. Hudson made tea, I coffee, and we then
        retired each one to his blanket-bag; the Taugwalders, Lord Francis
        Douglas, and myself, occupying the tent, the <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>others remaining, by preference, outside. Long
        after dusk the cliffs above echoed with our laughter and with the
        songs of the guides, for we were happy that night in camp, and feared
        no evil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We assembled
        together outside the tent before dawn on the morning of the 14th, and
        started directly it was light enough to move. Young Peter came on
        with us as a guide, and his brother returned to Zermatt.<a id=
        "noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a> We
        followed the route which had been taken on the previous day, and in a
        few minutes turned the rib which had intercepted the view of the
        eastern face from our tent platform. The whole of this great slope
        was now revealed, rising for 3000 feet like a huge natural
        staircase.<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href=
        "#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a> Some
        parts were more, and others were less, easy; but we were not once
        brought to a halt by any serious impediment, for when an obstruction
        was met in front it could always be turned to the right or to the
        left. For the greater part of the way there was, indeed, no occasion
        for the rope, and sometimes Hudson led, sometimes myself. At 6.20 we
        had attained a height of 12,800 feet, and halted for half-an-hour; we
        then continued the ascent without a break until 9.55, when we stopped
        for 50 minutes, at a height of 14,000 feet. Twice we struck the N.E.
        ridge, and followed it for some little distance,<a id="noteref_221"
        name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a>—to no
        advantage, for it was usually more rotten and steep, and always more
        difficult than the face.<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href=
        "#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a> Still,
        we kept near to it, lest stones perchance might fall.<a id=
        "noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href="#note_223"><span class=

        id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We had now arrived
        at the foot of that part which, from the Riffelberg or from Zermatt,
        seems perpendicular or overhanging, and could no longer continue upon
        the eastern side. For a little distance we ascended by snow upon the
        arête<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href=
        "#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a>—that
        is, the ridge—descending towards Zermatt, and then, by common
        consent, turned over to the right, or to the northern side. Before
        doing so, we made a change in the order of ascent. Croz went first, I
        followed, Hudson came third; Hadow and old Peter were last.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Now,”</span> said Croz, as he led off,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“now for something altogether
        different.”</span> The work became difficult, and required caution.
        In some places there was little to hold, and it was desirable that
        those should be in front who were least likely to slip. The general
        slope of the mountain at this part was <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">less</span></span> than
        40°, and snow had accumulated in, and had filled up, the interstices
        of the rock-face, leaving only occasional fragments projecting here
        and there. These were at times covered with a thin film of ice,
        produced from the melting and refreezing of the snow. It was the
        counterpart, on a small scale, of the upper 700 feet of the Pointe
        des Ecrins,—only there was this material difference; the face of the
        Ecrins was about, or exceeded, an angle of 50°, and the Matterhorn
        face was less than 40°.<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href=
        "#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a> It was
        a place over which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg
        278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>any
        fair mountaineer might pass in safety, and Mr. Hudson ascended this
        part, and, as far as I know, the entire mountain, without having the
        slightest assistance rendered to him upon any occasion. Sometimes,
        after I had taken a hand from Croz, or received a pull, I turned to
        offer the same to Hudson; but he invariably declined, saying it was
        not necessary. Mr. Hadow, however, was not accustomed to this kind of
        work, and required continual assistance. It is only fair to say that
        the difficulty which he found at this part arose simply and entirely
        from want of experience.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This solitary
        difficult part was of no great extent.<a id="noteref_226" name=
        "noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        away over it at first, nearly horizontally, for a distance of about
        400 feet; then ascended directly towards the summit for about 60
        feet; and then doubled back to the ridge which descends towards
        Zermatt. A long stride round a rather awkward corner brought us to
        snow once more. The last doubt vanished! The Matterhorn was ours!
        Nothing but 200 feet of easy snow remained to be surmounted!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You must now carry
        your thoughts back to the seven Italians who started from Breil on
        the 11th of July. Four days had passed since their departure, and we
        were tormented with anxiety lest they should arrive on the top before
        us. All the way up we had talked of them, and many false alarms of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“men on the summit”</span> had been raised.
        The higher we rose, the more intense became the excitement. What if
        we should be beaten at the last moment? The slope eased off, at
        length we could be detached, and Croz and I, dashing away, ran a
        neck-and-neck race, which ended in a dead heat. At 1.40 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> the
        world was at our feet, and the Matterhorn was conquered. Hurrah! Not
        a footstep could be seen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not yet
        certain that we had not been beaten. The summit of the Matterhorn was
        formed of a rudely level ridge, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>about 350 feet long,<a id="noteref_227" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a> and the
        Italians might have been at its farther extremity. I hastened to the
        southern end, scanning the snow right and left eagerly. Hurrah!
        again; it was untrodden. <span class="tei tei-q">“Where were the
        men?”</span> I peered over the cliff, half doubting, half expectant.
        I saw them immediately—mere dots on the ridge, at an immense distance
        below. Up went my arms and my hat. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        Monsieur?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“There, don’t you see them,

        they are low down.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Croz, we must
        make those fellows hear us.”</span> We yelled until we were hoarse.
        The Italians seemed to regard us—we could not be certain.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Croz, we <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></span> make

        block of rock and hurled it down, and called upon my companion, in
        the name of friendship, to do the same. We drove our sticks in, and
        prized away the crags, and soon a torrent of stones poured down the
        cliffs. There was no mistake about it this time. The Italians turned
        and fled.<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href=

        that the leader of that party could have stood with us at that
        moment, for our victorious shouts conveyed to him the disappointment
        of the ambition of a lifetime. He was <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></span> man,
        of all those who attempted the ascent of the Matterhorn, who most
        deserved to be the first upon its summit. He was the first to doubt
        its inaccessibility, and he was the only man who persisted in
        believing that its ascent would be accomplished. It was the aim of
        his life to make the ascent from the side of Italy, for the honour of
        his native valley. For a time he had the game in his hands: he played
        it as he thought best; but he made a false move, and he lost it.
        Times have changed with Carrel. His supremacy is questioned in the
        Val Tournanche; new men have arisen; and he is no longer recognised
        as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        though so long as he remains the man that he is to-day, it will not

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The others had
        arrived, so we went back to the northern end of the ridge. Croz now
        took the tent-pole,<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href=

        planted it in the highest snow. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span>
        we said, <span class="tei tei-q">“there is the flag-staff, but where
        is the flag?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Here it is,”</span> he
        answered, pulling off his blouse <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        and there was no wind to float it out, yet it was seen all around.
        They saw it at Zermatt—at the Riffel—in the Val Tournanche. At Breil,
        the watchers cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“Victory is ours!”</span>
        They raised <span class="tei tei-q">“bravos”</span> for Carrel, and

        themselves <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is true,”</span> said the men.

        was one of those superlatively calm and clear ones which usually
        precede bad weather. The atmosphere was perfectly still, and free
        from all clouds or vapours. Mountains fifty—nay a hundred—miles off,
        looked sharp and near. All their details—ridge and crag, snow and
        glacier—stood out with faultless definition. Pleasant thoughts of
        happy days in bygone years came up unbidden, as we recognised the
        old, familiar forms. All were revealed—not one of the
        prin<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name=

        "#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a> I see
        them clearly now—the great inner circles of giants, backed by the
        ranges, chains, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">massifs</span></span>. First came the Dent
        Blanche, hoary and grand; the Gabelhorn and pointed Rothhorn; and
        then the peerless Weisshorn: the towering Mischabelhörner, flanked by
        the Allaleinhorn, Strahlhorn, and Rimpfischhorn; then Monte Rosa—with
        its many Spitzes—the Lyskamm and the Breithorn. Behind was the
        Bernese Oberland governed by the Finsteraarhorn, and then the Simplon
        and St. Gothard groups; the Disgrazia and the Orteler. Towards the
        south we looked down to Chivasso on the plain of Piedmont, and far
        beyond. The Viso—one hundred miles away—seemed close upon us; the
        Maritime Alps—one hundred and thirty miles distant—were free from
        haze. Then came my first love—the Pelvoux; the Ecrins and the Meije;
        the clusters of the Graians; and lastly, in the west, gorgeous in the
        full sunlight, rose the monarch of all—Mont Blanc. Ten thousand feet
        beneath us were the green fields of Zermatt, dotted with chalets,
        from which blue smoke rose lazily. Eight thousand feet below, on the
        other side, were the pastures of Breil. There were black and gloomy
        forests, bright and cheerful meadows; bounding waterfalls and
        tranquil lakes; fertile lands and savage wastes; sunny plains and
        frigid <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">plateaux</span></span>. There were the most
        rugged forms, and the most graceful outlines—bold, perpendicular
        cliffs, and gentle, undulating slopes; rocky mountains and snowy
        mountains, sombre and solemn, or glittering and white, with
        walls—turrets—pinnacles—pyramids—domes—cones—and spires! There was
        every combination that the world can give, and every contrast that
        the heart could desire.</p>

        Hadow second; Hudson, who was almost equal to a guide in sureness of
        foot, wished to be third; Lord F. Douglas was placed next, and old
        Peter, the strongest of the remainder, after him. I suggested to
        Hudson that we should attach a rope to the rocks on our arrival at
        the difficult bit, and hold it as we descended, as an additional
        protection. He approved the idea, but it was not definitely settled
        that it should be done. The party was being <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>arranged in the above order whilst I was
        sketching the summit, and they had finished, and were waiting for me
        to be tied in line, when some one remembered that our names had not
        been left in a bottle. They requested me to write them down, and
        moved off while it was being done.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few minutes
        afterwards I tied myself to young Peter, ran down after the others,

        care was being taken. Only one man was moving at a time; when he was
        firmly planted the next advanced, and so on. They had not, however,
        attached the additional rope to rocks, and nothing was said about it.
        The suggestion was not made for my own sake, and I am not sure that
        it even occurred to me again. For some little distance we two
        followed the others, detached from them, and should have continued so
        had not Lord F. Douglas asked me, about 3 <span class=

        on to old Peter, as he feared, he said, that Taugwalder would not be

            ROPE BROKEN ON THE MATTERHORN.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So perished our
        comrades! For the space of half-an-hour we remained on the spot
        without moving a single step. The two men, paralysed by terror, cried
        like infants, and trembled in such a manner as to threaten us with
        the fate of the others. Old Peter rent the air with exclamations of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Chamounix! Oh, what will Chamounix
        say?”</span> He meant, Who would believe that Croz could fall? The
        young man did nothing but scream or sob, <span class="tei tei-q">“We
        are lost! we are lost!”</span> Fixed between the two, I could neither
        move up nor down. I begged young Peter to descend, but he dared not.
        Unless he did, we could not advance. Old Peter became alive to the
        danger, and swelled the cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are lost! we
        are lost!”</span> The father’s fear was natural—he trembled for his
        son; the young man’s fear was cowardly—he thought of self alone. At
        last old Peter summoned up courage, and changed his position to a
        rock to which he could fix the rope; the young man then descended,
        and we all stood together. Immediately we did so, I asked for the
        rope which had given way, and found, to my surprise—indeed, to my
        horror—that it was the weakest of the three ropes. It was not
        brought, and should not have been employed, for the purpose for which
        it was used. It was old rope, and, compared with the others, was
        feeble. It was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg
        288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>intended as a reserve, in case we had to leave
        much rope behind, attached to rocks. I saw at once that a serious
        question was involved, and made him give me the end. It had broken in
        mid-air, and it did not appear to have sustained previous injury.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For more than two
        hours afterwards I thought almost every moment that the next would be
        my last; for the Taugwalders, utterly unnerved, were not only
        incapable of giving assistance, but were in such a state that a slip
        might have been expected from them at any moment. After a time we
        were able to do that which should have been done at first, and fixed
        rope to firm rocks, in addition to being tied together. These ropes
        were cut from time to time, and were left behind.<a id="noteref_239"

        with their assurance the men were sometimes afraid to proceed, and
        several times old Peter turned with ashy face and faltering limbs,
        and said, with terrible emphasis, <span class=

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> we arrived at the snow upon the
        ridge descending towards Zermatt, and all peril was over. We
        frequently looked, but in vain, for traces of our unfortunate
        companions; we bent over the ridge and cried to them, but no sound
        returned. Convinced at last that they were neither within sight nor
        hearing, we ceased from our useless efforts; and, too cast down for
        speech, silently gathered up our things, and the little effects of
        those who were lost, preparatory to continuing the descent. When, lo!
        a mighty arch appeared, rising above the Lyskamm, high into the sky.
        Pale, colourless, and noiseless, but perfectly sharp and defined,
        except where it was lost in the clouds, this unearthly apparition
        seemed like a vision from another world; and, almost appalled, we
        watched with amazement the gradual development of two vast crosses,
        one on either side. If the Taugwalders had not been the first to
        perceive it, I should have doubted my senses. They thought it had
        some connection with the accident, and I, after a while, that it
        might bear some relation to ourselves. But our <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>movements had no effect upon it. The
        spectral forms remained motionless. It was a fearful and wonderful
        sight; unique in my experience, and impressive beyond description,
        coming at such a moment.<a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was ready to
        leave, and waiting for the others. They had recovered their appetites
        and the use of their tongues. They spoke in patois, which I did not
        understand. At length the son <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“that is nonsense; I shall pay you, of
        course, just as if your Herr were here.”</span> They talked together
        in their patois for a short time, and then the son spoke again.

        they knew very well the indignation that I felt. They filled the cup
        of bitterness to overflowing, and I tore down the cliff, madly and
        recklessly, in a way that caused them, more than once, to inquire if
        I wished to kill them. Night fell; and for an hour the descent was
        continued in the darkness. At half-past 9 a resting-place was found,
        and upon a wretched slab, barely large enough to hold the three, we
        passed six miserable hours. At daybreak the descent was resumed, and
        from the Hörnli ridge we ran down to the chalets of Buhl, and on to
        Zermatt. Seiler met me at his door, and followed in silence to my
        room. <span class="tei tei-q">“What is the matter?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Taugwalders and I have returned.”</span>
        He did not need more, and burst into tears; but lost no time in
        useless lamentations, and set to work to arouse the village. Ere long
        a score of men had started <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg
        291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
        ascend the Hohlicht heights, above Kalbermatt and Z’Mutt, which
        commanded the plateau of the Matterhorngletscher. They returned after
        six hours, and reported that they had seen the bodies lying
        motionless on the snow. This was on Saturday; and they proposed that
        we should leave on Sunday evening, so as to arrive upon the plateau
        at daybreak on Monday. Unwilling to lose the slightest chance, the
        Rev. J. M’Cormick and I resolved to start on Sunday morning. The
        Zermatt men, threatened with excommunication by their priests if they
        failed to attend the early mass, were unable to accompany us. To
        several of them, at least, this was a severe trial. Peter Perrn
        declared with tears that nothing else would have prevented him from
        joining in the search for his old comrades. Englishmen came to our
        aid. The Rev. J. Robertson and Mr. J. Phillpotts offered themselves,
        and their guide Franz Andermatten;<a id="noteref_244" name=

        Englishman lent us Joseph Marie and Alexandre Lochmatter. Frédéric
        Payot and Jean Tairraz, of Chamounix, also volunteered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We started at 2
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        the route that we had taken on the previous Thursday as far as the
        Hörnli. From thence we went down to the right of the ridge,<a id=

        strong rope, and, consequently, there had been only one link—that
        between old Peter and Lord F. Douglas—where the weaker rope had been
        used. This had a very ugly look for Taugwalder, for it was not
        possible to suppose that the others would have sanctioned the
        employment of a rope so greatly inferior in strength when there were
        more than 250 feet <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg

        legends of a more real character. Others will essay to scale its

        early explorers. Others may tread its summit-snows, but none will
        ever know the feelings of those who first gazed upon its marvellous
        panorama; and none, I trust, will ever be compelled to tell of joy
        turned into grief, and of laughter into mourning. It proved to be a

        defeated at last with an ease that none could have anticipated, but,
        like a relentless enemy—conquered but not crushed—it took terrible
        vengeance. The time may come when the Matterhorn shall have passed
        away, and nothing, save a heap of shapeless fragments, will mark the
        spot where the great mountain stood; for, atom by atom, inch by inch,
        and yard by yard, it yields to forces which nothing can withstand.
        That time is far distant; and, ages hence, generations unborn will
        gaze upon its awful precipices, and wonder at its unique form.

        mountain-scrambling have constantly set before us the superiority of
        fixed purpose or perseverance to brute force. We know that each
        height, each step, must be gained by patient, laborious toil, and
        that wishing cannot take the place of working; we know the benefits
        of mutual aid; that many a difficulty must be encountered, and many
        an obstacle must be grappled with or turned, but we know that where
        there’s a will there’s a way: and we come back to our daily
        occupations better fitted to fight the battle of life, and to
        overcome the impediments which obstruct our paths, strengthened and
        cheered by the recollection of past labours, and by the memories of
        victories gained in other fields.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have not made
        myself an apologist for mountaineering, nor do I now intend to usurp
        the functions of a moralist; but my <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>task would have been ill performed if it had
        been concluded without one reference to the more serious lessons of
        the mountaineer. We glory in the physical regeneration which is the
        product of our exertions; we exult over the grandeur of the scenes
        that are brought before our eyes, the splendours of sunrise and
        sunset, and the beauties of hill, dale, lake, wood, and waterfall;
        but we value more highly the development of manliness, and the
        evolution, under combat with difficulties, of those noble qualities
        of human nature—courage, patience, endurance, and fortitude.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some hold these
        virtues in less estimation, and assign base and contemptible motives
        to those who indulge in our innocent sport.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-lg" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
          <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">
            <span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Be thou chaste
            as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.”</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others, again, who
        are not detractors, find mountaineering, as a sport, to be wholly
        unintelligible. It is not greatly to be wondered at—we are not all
        constituted alike. Mountaineering is a pursuit essentially adapted to
        the young or vigorous, and not to the old or feeble. To the latter,
        toil may be no pleasure; and it is often said by such persons,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“This man is making a toil of
        pleasure.”</span> Let the motto on the title-page be an answer, if an
        answer be required. Toil he must who goes mountaineering; but out of
        the toil comes strength (not merely muscular energy—more than that),
        an awakening of all the faculties; and from the strength arises
        pleasure. Then, again, it is often asked, in tones which seem to
        imply that the answer must, at least, be doubtful, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But does it repay you?”</span> Well, we cannot estimate
        our enjoyment as you measure your wine, or weigh your lead,—it is
        real, nevertheless. If I could blot out every reminiscence, or erase
        every memory, still I should say that my scrambles amongst the Alps
        have repaid me, for they have given me two of the best things a man
        can possess—health and friends.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The recollections
        of past pleasures cannot be effaced. Even now as I write they crowd
        up before me. First comes an endless series of pictures, magnificent
        in form, effect, and colour. I see the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>great peaks, with clouded tops, seeming to mount
        up for ever and ever; I hear the music of the distant herds, the
        peasant’s jodel, and the solemn church-bells; and I scent the
        fragrant breath of the pines: and after these have passed away,
        another train of thoughts succeeds—of those who have been upright,
        brave, and true; of kind hearts and bold deeds; and of courtesies
        received at stranger hands, trifles in themselves, but expressive of
        that good will towards men which is the essence of charity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still, the last,
        sad memory hovers round, and sometimes drifts across like floating
        mist, cutting off sunshine, and chilling the remembrance of happier
        times. There have been joys too great to be described in words, and
        there have been griefs upon which I have not dared to dwell; and with
        these in mind I say, Climb if you will, but remember that courage and
        strength are nought without prudence, and that a momentary negligence
        may destroy the happiness of a lifetime. Do nothing in haste; look
        well to each step; and from the beginning think what may be the
        end.</p><a name="fig88" id="fig88" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On February 28,
          1864, Mr. P. C. Gosset and Mr. B—— started from the village of
          Ardon (about mid-way between Sion and Martigny), to make the ascent
          of the Haut-de-Cry (9688 feet), with the guides J. J. Nance, F.
          Rebot, A. Bevard, and J. J. Bennen. They arrived within a few
          hundred feet of the summit before mid-day, and determined to
          complete the ascent by following the crest of a ridge leading
          towards the east. Before this could be done it was necessary to
          cross some steep snow; and, while passing this, an avalanche was
          unfortunately started. Bennen and Mr. B—— perished; the others
          happily escaped. The following narrative, from the pen of Mr.
          Gosset, illustrates, in a very impressive manner, the danger of
          traversing new-fallen snow at considerable inclinations:—</p>

          <div class="block tei tei-p" style=
          "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
          <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
          "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">We had to go
          up a steep snow-field, about 800 feet high, as well as I remember.
          It was about 150 feet broad at the top, and 400 or 500 at the
          bottom. It was a sort of couloir on a large scale. During the
          ascent we sank about one foot deep at every step. Bennen did not
          seem to like the look of the snow very much. He asked the local
          guides whether avalanches ever came down this couloir, to which
          they answered that our position was perfectly safe. We had mounted
          on the northern side of the couloir, and having arrived at 150 feet
          from the top, we began crossing it on a horizontal curve, so as to
          gain the E. arête. The inflexion or dip of the couloir was slight,
          not above 25 feet, the inclination near 35°. We were walking in the
          following order:—Bevard, Nance, Bennen, myself, B., and Rebot.
          Having crossed over about three-quarters of the breadth of the
          couloir, the two leading men suddenly sank considerably above their
          waists. Bennen tightened the rope. The snow was too deep to think
          of getting out of the hole they had made, so they advanced one or
          two steps, dividing the snow with their bodies. Bennen turned round
          and told us he was afraid of starting an avalanche; we asked
          whether it would not be better to return and cross the couloir
          higher up. To this the three Ardon men opposed themselves; they
          mistook the proposed precaution for fear, and the two leading men
          continued their work. After three or four steps gained in the
          aforesaid manner, the snow became hard again. Bennen had not
          moved—he was evidently undecided what he should do; as soon,
          however, as he saw hard snow again, he advanced and crossed
          parallel to, but above, the furrow the Ardon men had made. Strange
          to say, the snow supported him. While he was passing I observed
          that the leader, Bevard, had ten or twelve feet of rope coiled
          round his shoulder. I of course at once told him to uncoil it and
          get on the arête, from which he was not more than fifteen feet
          distant. Bennen then told me to follow. I tried his steps, but sank
          up to my waist in the very first. So I went through the furrows,
          holding my elbows close to my body, so as not to touch the sides.
          This furrow was about twelve feet long, and as the snow was good on
          the other side, we had all come to the false conclusion that</span>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name=
          "Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style=
          "font-size: 90%">the snow was accidentally softer there than
          elsewhere. Bennen advanced; he had made but a few steps when we
          heard a deep, cutting sound. The snow-field split in two about
          fourteen or fifteen feet above us. The cleft was at first quite
          narrow, not more than an inch broad. An awful silence ensued; it
          lasted but a few seconds, and then it was broken by Bennen’s
          voice,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">
            ‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">We are all
            lost.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span>
            <span style="font-size: 90%">His words were slow and solemn, and
            those who knew him felt what they really meant when spoken by
            such a man as Bennen. They were his last words. I drove my
            alpenstock into the snow, and brought the weight of my body to
            bear on it. I then waited. It was an awful moment of suspense. I
            turned my head towards Bennen to see whether he had done the same
            thing. To my astonishment I saw him turn round, face the valley,
            and stretch out both arms. The snow on which we stood began to
            move slowly, and I felt the utter uselessness of any alpenstock.
            I soon sank up to my shoulders, and began descending backwards.
            From this moment I saw nothing of what had happened to the rest
            of the party. With a good deal of trouble I succeeded in turning
            round. The speed of the avalanche increased rapidly, and before
            long I was covered up with snow. I was suffocating when I
            suddenly came to the surface again. I was on a wave of the
            avalanche, and saw it before me as I was carried down. It was the
            most awful sight I ever saw. The head of the avalanche was
            already at the spot where we had made our last halt. The head
            alone was preceded by a thick cloud of snow-dust; the rest of the
            avalanche was clear. Around me I heard the horrid hissing of the
            snow, and far before me the thundering of the foremost part of
            the avalanche. To prevent myself sinking again, I made use of my
            arms much in the same way as when swimming in a standing
            position. At last I noticed that I was moving slower; then I saw
            the pieces of snow in front of me stop at some yards’ distance;
            then the snow straight before me stopped, and I heard on a large
            scale the same creaking sound that is produced when a heavy cart
            passes over frozen snow in winter. I felt that I also had
            stopped, and instantly threw up both arms to protect my head in
            case I should again be covered up. I had stopped, but the snow
            behind me was still in motion; its pressure on my body was so
            strong, that I thought I should be crushed to death. This
            tremendous pressure lasted but a short time; I was covered up by
            snow coming from behind me. My first impulse was to try and
            uncover my head—but this I could not do, the avalanche had frozen
            by pressure the moment it stopped, and I was frozen in. Whilst
            trying vainly to move my arms, I suddenly became aware that the
            hands as far as the wrist had the faculty of motion. The
            conclusion was easy, they must be above the snow. I set to work
            as well as I could; it was time, for I could not have held out
            much longer. At last I saw a faint glimmer of light. The crust
            above my head was getting thinner, but I could not reach it any
            more with my hands; the idea struck me that I might pierce it
            with my breath. After several efforts I succeeded in doing so,
            and felt suddenly a rush of air towards my mouth. I saw the sky
            again through a little round hole. A dead silence reigned around
            me; I was so surprised to be still alive, and so persuaded at the
            first moment that none of my fellow-sufferers had survived, that
            I did not even think of shouting for them. I then made vain
            efforts to extricate my arms,</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">but found it
            impossible; the most I could do was to join the ends of my
            fingers, but they could not reach the snow any longer. After a
            few minutes I heard a man shouting; what a relief it was to know
            that I was not the sole survivor! to know that perhaps he was not
            frozen in and could come to my assistance! I answered; the voice
            approached, but seemed uncertain where to go, and yet it was now
            quite near. A sudden exclamation of surprise! Rebot had seen my
            hands. He cleared my head in an instant, and was about to try and
            cut me out completely, when I saw a foot above the snow, and so
            near to me that I could touch it with my arms, although they were
            not quite free yet. I at once tried to move the foot; it was my
            poor friend’s. A pang of agony shot through me as I saw that the
            foot did not move. Poor B. had lost sensation, and was perhaps
            already dead. Rebot did his best: after some time he wished me to
            help him, so he freed my arms a little more so that I could make
            use of them. I could do but little, for Rebot had torn the axe
            from my shoulder as soon as he had cleared my head (I generally
            carry an axe separate from my alpenstock—the blade tied to the
            belt, and the handle attached to the left shoulder). Before
            coming to me Rebot had helped Nance out of the snow; he was lying
            nearly horizontally, and was not much covered over. Nance found
            Bevard, who was upright in the snow, but covered up to the head.
            After about twenty minutes the two last-named guides came up. I
            was at length taken out; the snow had to be cut with the axe down
            to my feet before I could be pulled out. A few minutes after one
            o’clock</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span><span style=
            "font-size: 90%">we came to my poor friend’s face.... I wished
            the body to be taken out completely, but nothing could induce the
            three guides to work any longer, from the moment they saw that it
            was too late to save him. I acknowledge that they were nearly as
            incapable of doing anything as I was. When I was taken out of the
            snow the cord had to be cut. We tried the end going towards
            Bennen, but could not move it; it went nearly straight down, and
            showed us that there was the grave of the bravest guide the
            Valais ever had, and ever will have. The cold had done its work
            on us; we could stand it no longer, and began the
            descent.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

            the wind southerly. When very near to the summit an extremely
            loud thunder-clap was heard, and we thought it prudent to
            descend. We commenced the descent in the following

            <span style="font-size: 90%">I received a sharp, stinging blow on
            the leg, and thought, at first, that a stone had been dislodged;
            but a loud thunder-clap at once told me what it was. Perrn also
            said that he had been hit on the leg. In a few moments I received
            a hit on the right arm, which seemed to run along it, and
            resembled a shock from a galvanic battery. At the same time all
            the men gave a startled shriek, and exclaimed that they were hit
            by lightning. The storm continued near us for some little time,
            and then gradually died away. On arriving at the</span>

            <span style="font-size: 90%">I found that Perrn had a long sore
            on his arm; next morning his leg was much swollen and very weak.
            We descended to Breil on the following day, and crossed to
            Zermatt. The same day my hand began to swell, and it continued
            very weak for about a week. Maquignaz’s neck was much swollen on
            each side; the lightning hitting him (according to his account)
            on the back, and upon each side of the neck. Taugwalder’s leg was
            also slightly swollen. The thunder was tremendous—louder than I
            have ever heard it before. There was no wind, nor rain, and
            everything was in a mist.</span><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Val
          Tournanche natives who started to facilitate the way up the
          south-west ridge of the Matterhorn for MM. Giordano and Sella,
          pitched their tent upon my third platform, at the foot of the Great
          Tower (12,992 feet), and enjoyed several days of bad weather under
          its shelter. On the first fine day (13th of July) they began their
          work, and about midday on the 14th got on to the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“shoulder,”</span> and arrived at the base of the final
          peak (the point where Bennen stopped on July 28, 1862). The
          counsels of the party were then divided. Two—Jean-Antoine Carrel
          and Joseph Maquignaz—wished to go on; the others were not eager
          about it. A discussion took place, and the result was they all
          commenced to descend, and whilst upon the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“cravate”</span> (13,524) they heard our cries from the
          summit.<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href=
          "#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a> Upon
          the 15th they went down to Breil and reported their ill-success to
          M. Giordano (see <a href="#Pg281" class="tei tei-ref">p. 281</a>).
          That gentleman was naturally much disappointed, and pressed the men
          to set out again.<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href=
          "#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          he, <span class="tei tei-q">“Until now I have striven for the
          honour of making the first ascent,—fate has decided <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>against me,—I am beaten. Patience! Now,
          if I make further sacrifices it will be on your account, for your
          honour, and for your interests. Will you start again to settle the
          question, or, at least, to let there be no more
          uncertainty?”</span> The majority of the men (in fact the whole of
          them with the exception of Jean-Antoine) refused point-blank to
          have anything more to do with the mountain. Carrel, however,
          stepped forward, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“As for me, I have
          not given it up; if you (turning to the Abbé Gorret) or the others
          will come, I will start again immediately.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Not I!”</span> said one. <span class="tei tei-q">“No
          more for me,”</span> cried a second. <span class="tei tei-q">“If
          you would give me a thousand francs I would not go back,”</span>
          said a third. The Abbé Gorret alone volunteered. This plucky priest
          was concerned in the very first attempts upon the mountain,<a id=
          "noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href="#note_261"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          is an enthusiastic mountaineer. Carrel and the Abbé would have set
          out by themselves had not J. B. Bich and J.-A. Meynet (two men in
          the employ of Favre the innkeeper) come forward at the last moment.
          M. Giordano also wished to accompany them, but the men knew the
          nature of the work they had to undertake, and positively declined
          to be accompanied by an amateur.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These four men
          left Breil at 6.30 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          arrived at the third tent-platform, and there passed the night. At
          daybreak on the 17th they continued the ascent by the route which
          had been taken before; passed successively the Great Tower, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“crête du coq,”</span> the <span class=

          at 10 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> gained the point at the foot of
          the final peak from which the explorers had turned back on the
          14th.<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href=
          "#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a> They
          had then about 800 feet to accomplish, and, says the Abbé,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“nous allions entrer en pays inconnu, aucun
          n’étant jamais allé aussi loin.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passage of
          the cleft which stopped Bennen was accomplished, and then the party
          proceeded directly towards the summit, over rocks which for some
          distance were not particularly difficult. The steep cliffs down
          which we had hurled stones (on the 14th) then stopped their way,
          and Carrel led round to the left or Z’Mutt side. The work at this
          part was of the very greatest difficulty, and stones and icicles
          which fell rendered the position of the party very
          precarious;<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href=
          "#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a> so
          much so that they preferred to turn up directly towards the summit,
          and climb by rocks that the Abbé termed <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“almost perpendicular.”</span> He added, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This part occupied the most time, and gave us the
          greatest trouble.”</span> At length they arrived at a fault in the
          rocks which formed a roughly horizontal gallery. They crept along
          this in the direction of a ridge that descended towards the
          north-west, or thereabouts, and when close to the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ridge, found that they could not climb
          on to it; but they perceived that, by descending a gully with
          perpendicular sides, they could reach the ridge at a lower point.
          The bold Abbé was the heaviest and the strongest of the four, and
          he was sacrificed for the success of the expedition. He and Meynet
          remained behind, and lowered the others, one by one, into the
          gully. Carrel and Bich clambered up the other side, attained the
          ridge descending towards the north-west, shortly afterwards gained
          an <span class="tei tei-q">“easy route, they
          galloped,”</span><a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href=
          "#note_265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a> and
          in a few minutes reached the southern end of the summit-ridge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time of
          their arrival does not appear to have been noticed. It was late in
          the day, I believe about 3 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> Carrel and his comrade only
          waited long enough to plant a flag by the side of the cairn that we
          had built three days previously, then descended at once, rejoined
          the others, and all four hurried down as fast as possible to the
          tent. They were so pressed for time that they could not eat! and it
          was 9 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> before they arrived at their
          camp at the foot of the Great Tower. In descending they followed
          the gallery above mentioned throughout its entire length, and so
          avoided the very difficult rocks over which they had passed on the
          ascent. As they were traversing the length of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“shoulder”</span> they witnessed the phenomenon to
          which I have already adverted at the foot of <a href="#Pg289"
          class="tei tei-ref">p. 289</a>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Carrel and
          Bich were near the summit they saw our traces upon the
          Matterhorngletscher, and suspected that an accident had occurred;
          they did not, however, hear of the Matterhorn catastrophe until
          their return to Breil, at 3 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> upon the 18th. The details of
          that sad event were in the mouths of all, and it was not
          unnaturally supposed, in the absence of correct information, that
          the accident was a proof that the northern side was frightfully
          dangerous. The safe return of the four Italians was regarded, on
          the other hand, as evidence that the Breil route was the best.
          Those who were interested (either personally or otherwise) in the
          Val Tournanche made the most of the circumstances, and trumpeted
          the praises of the southern route. Some went farther, and
          instituted comparisons between the two routes to the disadvantage
          of the northern one, and were pleased to term our expedition on the
          13-14th of July precipitate, and so forth. Considering the
          circumstances which caused us to leave the Val Tournanche on the
          12th of July, these remarks were not in the best possible taste,
          but I have no feeling regarding them. There may be some, however,
          who may be interested in a comparison of the two routes, and for
          their sakes I will place the essential points in juxtaposition. We
          (that is the Taugwalders and myself) were absent from Zermatt 53
          hours. Excluding halts and stoppages of one sort or another, the
          ascent and descent occupied us 23 hours. Zermatt is 5315 feet above
          the level of the sea, and the Matterhorn is 14,780; we had
          therefore to ascend 9465 feet. As far as the point marked 10,820
          feet the way was known, so we had to find the way over only 3960
          feet. The members of our party (I now include all) were very
          unequal in ability, and none of us could for a moment be compared
          as cragsmen with Jean-Antoine Carrel. The four Italians who started
          from Breil on the 16th of July were absent during <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>56½ hours, and as far as I can gather
          from the published account, and from conversation with the men,
          excluding halts, they took for the ascent and descent 23¾ hours.
          The hotel at Breil is 6890 feet above the sea, so they had to
          ascend 7890 feet. As far as the end of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“shoulder”</span> the way was known to Carrel, and he
          had to find the way over only about 800 feet. All four men were
          born mountaineers, good climbers, and they were led by the most
          expert cragsman I have seen. The weather in each instance was fine.
          It is seen, therefore, that these four nearly equally matched men
          took a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">longer</span></span> time to ascend 1500 feet
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">less</span></span> height than ourselves,
          although we had to find the way over more than four times as much
          untrodden ground as they. This alone would lead any mountaineer to
          suppose that their route must have been more difficult than
          ours.<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href=
          "#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a> I
          know the greater part of the ground over which they passed, and
          from my knowledge, and from the account of Mr. Grove, I am sure
          that their route was not only more difficult, but that it was
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">much</span></span> more difficult than
          ours.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was not the
          opinion in the Val Tournanche at the end of 1865, and the natives
          confidently reckoned that tourists would flock to their side in
          preference to the other. It was, I believe, the late Canon Carrel
          of Aosta (who always took great interest in such matters) who first
          proposed the construction of a <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cabane</span></span>
          upon the southern side of the Matterhorn. The project was taken up
          with spirit, and funds for its execution were speedily
          provided—principally by the members of the Italian Alpine Club, or
          by their friends. The indefatigable Carrel found a natural hole
          upon the ledge called the <span class="tei tei-q">“cravate”</span>
          (13,524), and this, in course of time, was turned, under his
          direction, into a respectable little hut. Its position is superb,
          and gives a view of the most magnificent character.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst this work
          was being carried out, my friend Mr. F. Craufurd Grove consulted me
          respecting the ascent of the Matterhorn. I recommended him to
          ascend by the northern route, and to place himself in the hands of
          Jean-Antoine Carrel. Mr. Grove found, however, that Carrel
          distinctly preferred the southern side, and they ascended
          accordingly by the Breil route. Mr. Grove has been good enough to
          supply the following account of his expedition. He carries on my
          description of the southern route from the highest point I attained
          on that side (a little below the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“cravate”</span>) to the summit, and thus renders
          complete my descriptions of the two sides.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 90%">The passage of this slope proved a

            human creatures managed to crawl over rocks so steep and so
            treacherous. After they had got about half-way across, they found
            the difficulties of the route and the danger from falling stones
            so great, that they struck straight up the mountain, in the hope
            of finding some safer way. They were to a certain extent
            successful, for they came presently to a small ledge, caused by a
            sort of fault in the rock, running horizontally across the
            north-western face of the mountain a little distance below the
            summit. Traversing this ledge, the Italians found themselves

            but still separated from it by a barrier, to outflank which it
            was necessary to descend a perpendicular gully. Carrel and Bich
            were lowered down this, the other two men remaining at the top to
            haul up their companions on their return, as otherwise they could
            not have got up again. Passing on to the Z’Mutt</span>

            <span style="font-size: 90%">without further difficulty, Carrel
            and Bich climbed by that ridge to the summit of the mountain. In

            north-western and southern faces. When I ascended in 1867, we
            followed this route in the ascent and in the descent. I thought
            the ledge difficult, in some places decidedly dangerous, and
            should not care to set foot on it again; but</span> <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Craufurd
          Grove was the first traveller who ascended the Matterhorn after the
          accident, and the natives of Val Tournanche were, of course,
          greatly delighted that his ascent was made upon their side. Some of
          them, however, were by no means well pleased that J.-A. Carrel was
          so much regarded. They feared, perhaps, that he would acquire the
          monopoly of the mountain. Just a month after Mr. Grove’s ascent,
          six Valtournanchians set out to see whether they could not learn
          the route, and so come in for a share of the good things which were
          expected to arrive. They were three Maquignaz’s, Cæsar Carrel (my
          old guide), J.-B. Carrel, and a daughter of the last named! They
          left Breil at 5 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> on Sept. 12, and at 3
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> arrived at the hut, where they
          passed the night. At 7 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> the next day they started again
          (leaving J.-B. Carrel behind), and proceeded along the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“shoulder”</span> to the final peak; passed the cleft
          which had stopped Bennen, and clambered up the comparatively easy
          rocks on the other side until they arrived at the base of the last
          precipice, down which we had hurled stones on July 14, 1865. They
          (young woman and all) were then about 350 feet from the summit!
          Then, instead of turning to the left, as Carrel and Mr. Grove had
          done, Joseph and J.-Pierre Maquignaz paid attention to the cliff in
          front of them, and managed to find a means of passing up, by
          clefts, ledges, and gullies, to the summit. This was a shorter (and
          it appears to be an easier) route than that taken by Carrel and
          Grove, and it has been followed by all those who have since then
          ascended the mountain from the side of Breil.<a id="noteref_269"

          Subsequently, a rope was fixed over the most difficult portions of
          the final climb.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime
          they had not been idle upon the other side. A hut was constructed
          upon the eastern face, at a height of 12,526 feet above the sea,
          near to the crest of the ridge which descends towards Zermatt
          (north-east ridge). This was done at the expense of Monsieur Seiler
          and of the Swiss Alpine Club. Mons. Seiler placed the execution of
          the work under the direction of the Knubels, of the village of St.
          Nicholas, in the Zermatt valley; and Peter Knubel, along with
          Joseph Marie Lochmatter of the same village, had the honour of
          making the second ascent of the mountain upon the northern side
          with Mr. Elliott. This took place on July 24-25, 1868. Since then
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name=
          "Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>very numerous ascents
          have been made both on the Swiss and upon the Italian side. The
          list of ascents will, however, show that far more have been made by

          route.</p><a name="fig89" id="fig89" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Elliott
          supposed that he avoided the place where the accident occurred, and
          that he improved the northern route. This, however, is not the
          case. Both he and the others who have succeeded him have followed
          in all essential points the route which we took upon July 13-15,
          1865, with the exception of the deviations which I will point out.
          Upon leaving Zermatt, the traveller commences by crossing a bridge
          which is commonly termed the Matterhorn bridge, and proceeds to the
          chapel at the Schwarzsee. Thence he mounts the Hörnli, and follows
          its ridge along its entire length right up to the foot of the
          Matterhorn. There is now a good path along the whole of this ridge,
          but when we traversed it for the First Ascent there was not even so
          much as a faintly marked track. The first steps which are taken
          upon the mountain itself follow the exact line over which I myself
          led upon the first ascent, and the track presently passes over the
          precise spot upon which our tent was placed in 1865. In 1874, and
          again in 1876, I saw the initials which I marked on the rock by the
          side of our tent. The route now taken passes this rock, and then
          goes round the corner of the buttress to which I referred upon
          <a href="#Pg276" class="tei tei-ref">p. 276</a>. At this point the
          route now followed deviates somewhat from the line of our ascent,
          and goes more directly up to the part of the north-east ridge upon
          which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cabane</span></span> is placed. We bore more
          away on to the face of the mountain, and proceeded <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more directly towards the summit. At the
          upper part of the ascent of the north-east ridge the route now
          taken is exactly that of the first ascent until the foot of the
          final peak is reached; and there, instead of bearing away to the
          right, as we did, the tourist now clambers up directly towards the
          summit by means of the fixed ropes and chains. The final portion of
          the ascent, over the snow at the summit, again follows our
          route.</p><a name="fig90" id="fig90" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          ascents that have been made which are most worthy of note, that
          made by Signor Giordano may be mentioned first. This gentleman came
          to Breil several times after his famous visit in 1865, with the
          intention of making the ascent, but he was always baffled by the
          weather. In July 1866 he got as high as the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“cravate”</span> (with J. A. Carrel and other men) and
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was
          detained there five days and nights, unable to move either up or
          down</span></span>. At last, upon Sept. 3-5, 1868, he was able to
          gratify his desires, and accomplished the feat of ascending the
          mountain on one side and descending it upon the other. Signor
          Giordano is, I believe, the only geologist who has ascended the
          mountain. He spent a considerable time in the examination of its
          structure, and became benighted on its eastern face in consequence.
          I am indebted to him for the valuable note and the accompanying
          section which follow the Table of Ascents. Signor Giordano carried
          a mercurial barometer throughout the entire distance, and read it
          frequently. His observations have enabled me to determine with
          confidence and accuracy the heights which were attained upon the
          different attempts to ascend the mountain, and the various points
          upon it which have been so frequently mentioned throughout this
          volume.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Questions having
          been frequently put to me respecting the immediate summit of the
          Matterhorn, and difficulties having been expressed as to the
          recognition of the two views given upon <a href="#fig79" class=
          "tei tei-ref">pp. 279</a> and <a href="#fig80" class=
          "tei tei-ref">281</a>, I made an ascent of the mountain in 1874 to
          photograph the summit, in order that I might see what changes had
          occurred since our visit of ten years before. The summits of all
          high mountains vary from time to time, and I was not surprised to
          find that the Matterhorn was no exception to the general rule. It
          was altogether sharper and narrower in 1874 than 1865. Instead of
          being able <span class="tei tei-q">“to run about,”</span> every
          step had to be painfully cut with the axe; and the immediate
          summit, instead of being a blunt and rounded eminence, was a little
          piled-up cone of snow which went to a very sharp point. Our
          photographic operations were conducted with difficulty, for a
          furious north wind was blowing which would have whisked away the
          camera immediately if it had been set up in the most convenient
          position for taking a view; and we were compelled to cut a great
          gash in the snow and to work down upon the edge of the cliff
          overlooking Breil before we could escape from the gusts which were
          whirling away the snow in writhing eddies. My guides J. A. Carrel,
          Bic, and Lochmatter formed a strong party, and eventually we gained
          a position, protected from the wind, whence there was a good view
          of the summit; but our ledge was so small that we could not venture
          to unrope, and Carrel had to squat down whilst I photographed over
          his head. The <a href="#fig90" class="tei tei-ref">engraving upon
          p. 311</a> has been made from the photograph so taken. It will
          interest some of my readers to know that the nearest peak, seen
          below, is the summit of the Dent d’Hérens.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The light was
          not favourable for photographing the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cabane</span></span>
          when we returned from the summit, and I stopped alone with Carrel
          in it for a second night in order to get the morning light on the
          next day. Whilst quietly reposing inside, I was startled to hear a
          rustling and crackling sound, and jumped up, expecting that the
          building was about to take itself off to lower quarters; and
          presently I perceived that the hut had a tenant to whom I certainly
          did not expect to be introduced. A little, plump mouse came
          creeping out over the floor, being apparently of opinion that there
          ought not to be any one there at that time of day. It wandered
          about picking up stray fragments of food, occasionally crunching a
          bit of egg-shell, totally unaware of my presence, for I made out
          that the little animal was both blind and deaf. It would have been
          easy to capture it, but I would not do so, and left it there to
          keep company with other solitary tourists.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The view from
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cabane</span></span> extends from the
          Bietschhorn on the north to the Grand Tournalin in the south; and
          includes the Mischabel group, the Allalleinhorn and Alphubel, Mont
          Rosa, etc. etc. Its situation is not high enough to overlook those
          mountains, and so the prospect is very similar to the northern and
          eastern half of the view from the Riffel. The uppermost 800 feet of
          the Matterhorn can be seen from the hut, but the rest of the part
          above it is not visible, being hidden by a small ridge which
          projects from the face. Whilst stopping in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cabane</span></span>
          we had the insecurity of its position forcibly impressed upon us by
          seeing a huge block break away from the rock at its side, and go
          crashing down over the very route which is commonly pursued by
          tourists.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The year 1879 is
          a memorable one in the history of the Matterhorn, for in it there
          occurred two deaths upon the mountain, and two new routes were
          discovered. Sufficient information has not come to hand at the time
          I write upon what is termed the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">affaire Brantschen</span></span>”</span> to
          enable one to form a correct opinion about that lamentable
          business, and it is enough to say that upon August 12 a party
          started from Breil, composed of Dr. Lüscher, Prof. Schiess, and the
          guides J. M. Lochmatter, Jos. Brantschen, and Petryson of Evolena.
          They gained the hut on the <span class="tei tei-q">“cravate”</span>
          in due course, and on the following day the party crossed the
          mountain to Zermatt, with the exception of Brantschen, who was left
          behind in the hut, some say only slightly ill, and others at the
          point of death. Which of these was the case is only known by those
          concerned. They sent back assistance to their comrade in a somewhat
          tardy fashion, and when the relief party gained the hut Brantschen
          was found dead.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the time that
          this was taking place on the southern side of the Matterhorn, an
          accident occurred on the north-east face by which a life was lost.
          Messrs. A. E. Craven and Dr. Moseley (of Boston), with the guides
          Peter Rubi and C. Inabnit, left Zermatt at 10.30 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span> on the
          night of August 13, and ascended the mountain by the usual northern
          route without stopping at the hut. They reached the summit at 9
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> on the 14th, and had returned
          to within a short distance of the hut, when Dr. Moseley (who had
          found it irksome to be tied up, and had frequently wished to go
          unroped) untied himself from the rest, doing so entirely upon his
          own responsibility. A few minutes later, and within quite a short
          distance of the hut, the party had to cross a projecting piece of
          rock. Rubi went over first, and planted his axe in position to give
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name=
          "Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>firm footing to Dr.
          Moseley, who followed. But, unhappily, he declined assistance;
          placed his hand on the rock, and endeavoured to vault over it. In
          doing so he slipped, lost hold of his axe, and fell with ever
          accelerating velocity down almost the whole of the north-east face.
          He fell about 2000 feet, and was of course killed on the spot. His
          body was recovered three days later, and was interred in the
          English burying-ground at Zermatt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many persons
          have talked at different times about the possibility of finding a
          way up the Matterhorn from the side of the Z’Mutt glacier; but it
          was not until the year 1879 that a way was found. On September 2-3,
          Mr. A. F. Mummery, with the
          guides&nbsp;&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp;,
          succeeded in gaining the summit by first going up the long buttress
          of snow which runs out from the mountain to the Z’Mutt glacier, and
          then up the rocks above. I have been unable to procure any details
          respecting this expedition and my only information about it has
          been derived from Mr. Baumann, who followed in Mr. Mummery’s traces
          three days later. Mr. Baumann says: <span class="tei tei-q">“We
          followed the long ice-slope to its extreme upper end, then the
          jagged arête above it for a short distance, and then deviated a
          little to the right, climbing by a secondary rocky ridge descending
          towards the Stockhi until within an hour of the summit, when we
          struck the main Z’Mutt arête and so completed the ascent by joining
          the Breil route.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the very time
          that Mr. Mummery was occupied in his expedition, Mr. W. Penhall,
          with the guides F. Imseng and L. Sorbriehen, was engaged in a
          similar enterprise, and also ascended the Matterhorn from the
          direction of the Stockhi. He, however, at the first took a route
          closer to the Tiefenmatten glacier, though he at last, like the
          others, eventually got upon the main Z’Mutt arête and completed the
          ascent by following a portion of the Breil route.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Neither Mr.
          Mummery, nor Messrs. Baumann and Penhall, descended by the routes
          which they struck out, and in each case the respective parties
          descended by the northern or Zermatt route. It is therefore at
          present impossible to determine the relative difficulty of the
          various routes up the mountain. Still, I think that the great
          majority of tourists will, as heretofore, prefer the ordinary
          Zermatt route, and that comparatively few will patronize the
          newly-discovered ones.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ascent of
          the Matterhorn has now taken its place amongst those which are
          considered fashionable, and many persons get upon it who ought not
          to be upon a mountain at all. Although much has been done on both
          sides of it to facilitate the routes, and although they are much
          easier to traverse than they were in years gone by, it is still
          quite possible to get into trouble upon them, and to come utterly
          to grief. Considering how large a number of entirely incompetent
          persons venture upon the mountain, it is surprising so few meet
          with accidents; but if the number of accidents continues to
          increase at its present rate it will, ere long, not be easy to find
          a place of interment in the English churchyard at Zermatt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Le Matterhorn ou
          Mont Cervin est formé depuis la base jusqu’au sommet de roches
          stratifiées en bancs assez réguliers, qui sont tous légèrement
          rélevés vers l’Est, savoir vers le Mont Rose. Ces roches
          quoiqu’évidemment d’origine sédimentaire ont une structure
          fortement cristalline qui doit être l’effet d’une puissante action
          de métamorphisme très développée dans cette région des Alpes. Dans
          la série des roches constituantes du Mont Cervin l’on peut faire
          une distinction assez marquée, savoir celles formant la base
          inférieure de la montagne, et celles formant le pic proprement
          dit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Les roches de la
          base qu’on voit dans le Val Tournanche, dans le vallon de Z’Mutt,
          au col de Théodule et ailleurs, sont en général des schistes
          talqueux, serpentineux, chloriteux, et amphiboliques, alternant
          fort souvent avec des schistes calcaires à noyaux quartzeux. Ces
          schistes calcaires de couleur brunâtre alternent ça et là avec des
          dolomies, des cargueules, et des quartzites tégulaires. Cette
          formation calcaréo-serpentineuse est très étendue dans les
          environs. Le pic au contraire est tout formé d’un gneiss talqueux,
          souvent à gros éléments, alternant parfois à quelques bancs de
          schistes talqueux et quartzeux, mais sans bancs calcaires. Vers le
          pied ouest du pic, le gneiss est remplacé par de l’euphotide
          granitoïde massive, qui semble y former une grosse lentille se
          fondant de tous côtés dans le gneiss même. Du reste, les roches du
          Cervin montrent partout des exemples fort instructifs de passages
          graduels d’une structure à l’autre, résultant du métamorphisme plus
          ou moins avancé.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Le pic actuel
          n’est que le reste d’une puissante formation géologique ancienne,
          triasique peut-être, dont les couches puissantes de plus de 3500
          mètres enveloppaient tout autour comme un immense manteau le grand
          massif granitoïde et feldspathique du Mont Rose. Aussi son étude
          détaillée, qui par exception est rendue fort facile par la
          profondeur des vallons d’où il surgit, donne la clef de la
          structure géologique de beaucoup d’autres montagnes des environs.
          On y voit partout le phénomène assez curieux d’une puissante
          formation talqueuse très cristalline, presque granitoïde,
          régulièrement superposée à une formation schisteuse et calcarifère.
          Cette même constitution géologique est en partie la cause de la
          forme aiguë et de l’isolement du pic qui en font la merveille des
          voyageurs. En effet, tandis que les roches feuilletées de la base,
          étant facilement corrodées par l’action des météores et de l’eau,
          ont été facilement creusées en vallées larges et profondes, la
          roche supérieure qui constitue la pyramide donne lieu par sa dureté
          à des fendillements formant des parois escarpées qui conservent au
          pic ce profil élancé, et caractéristique alpin. Les glaciers qui
          entourent son pied de tous les côtés, en emportant d’une manière
          continue les débris tombant de ses flancs, contribuent pour leur
          part à maintenir cet isolement de la merveilleuse pyramide qui sans
          eux serait peut-être déjà ensevelie sous ses propres
          ruines.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg

            <span class="tei tei-q">“We were on the march home along the
            mountain plains, when, dazzled by the intense sun-rays reflected
            by the endless snow-fields we were marching along, my eyelids
            lost all power to open; I felt my elbow touched, and, looking
            through my fingers, I beheld one of our friendly highlanders
            preparing a kind of black paste by mixing gunpowder with snow.
            The General told me to let him do what he wanted. The Circassian
            applied the black stuff under my eyes, on my cheeks, and to the
            sides of my nose. To my astonishment I could then open my eyes,
            and felt no more difficulty to see plainly and clearly
            everything. I have tried that experiment many times since, and it
            never failed to relieve me, although I used common Indian-ink and
            black water-colour, instead of the above-mentioned
            paste.”</span></dd>

            supported upon their extremities) will bear a dead weight of 100
            lbs. suspended from their centres, will stand any wind to which
            they are likely to be submitted. Ash is, perhaps, the best wood

              few lichens are seen on the higher parts of this mountain;
              their rarity is due, doubtless, to the constant disintegration
              of the rocks, and the consequent exposure of fresh surfaces.

            class="tei tei-anchor"></a>I have already had occasion to mention
            the rapid changes which occur in the weather at considerable
            elevations in the Alps, and shall have to do so again in
            subsequent chapters. No one can regret more than myself the
            variable weather which afflicts that otherwise delightful chain
            of mountains, or the necessity of speaking about it: its summits
            appear to enjoy more than their fair share of wind and tempests.
            Meteorological disturbances, some would say, are by no means
            necessary accompaniments of high regions. There are some happy
            places which are said to be favoured with almost perpetual calm.
            Take the case of the Sierra Nevada of California, for example,
            which includes numerous summits from 13,000 to 15,000 feet. Mr.
            Whitney, of San Francisco, says (in his <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guide-book to the
            Yosemite Valley, and the adjacent region</span></span>),
            <span class="tei tei-q">“At high altitudes, all through the
            mountains, the weather during the summer is almost always the
            finest possible for travelling. There are occasional storms in
            the high mountains; but, in ordinary seasons, these are quite
            rare, and one of the greatest drawbacks to the pleasure of
            travelling in the Alps, the uncertainty of the weather, is here
            almost entirely wanting.”</span> It is probable that a more
            thorough acquaintance with that region will modify this opinion;
            for it must be admitted that it is very difficult to judge of the
            state of the atmosphere at great heights from the valleys, and it
            often occurs that a terrific storm is raging above when there is
            a dead calm below, at a distance perhaps of not more than three
            or four miles. A case of this kind is described in <a href=
            "#Pg114" class="tei tei-ref">Chapter VI.</a>, and another may be
            mentioned here. At the very time that I was regarding the Dent
            Blanche from a height of 12,550 feet on the Matterhorn, Mr. T. S.
            Kennedy was engaged in making the first ascent of the former
            mountain. He described his ascent in a very picturesque paper in
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Alpine Journal</span></span> (1863), and I
            learn from it that he experienced severe weather. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The wind roared over our ridge, making fearfully
            wild music among the desolate crags.... It rendered an ordinary
            voice inaudible,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“nothing at
            a distance greater than fifty yards could be seen at all....
            Thick mists and driving clouds of snow swept over and past
            us;”</span> the thermometer fell to 20° Fahr., and his
            companion’s hair became a mass of white icicles. Now, at this
            time, Mr. Kennedy was distant from me only four and a half miles.
            With me, and in my immediate neighbourhood, the air was perfectly
            calm, and the temperature was agreeably warm; even during the
            night it fell only two or three degrees below freezing-point.
            During most of the day the Dent Blanche was perfectly unclouded,
            though, for a time, light fleecy clouds were hovering about its
            upper 2000 feet. Still no one would have supposed from
            appearances that my friend was experiencing a storm such as he
            has described.</dd>

              happens that one survives such a fall, it may be interesting to
              record what my sensations were during its occurrence. I was
              perfectly conscious of what was happening, and felt each blow;
              but, like a patient under chloroform, experienced no pain. Each
              blow was, naturally, more severe than that which preceded it,
              and I distinctly remember thinking, <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“Well, if the next is harder still, that will be
              the end!”</span> Like persons who have been rescued from
              drowning, I remember that the recollection of a multitude of
              things rushed through my head, many of them trivialities or
              absurdities, which had been forgotten long before; and, more
              remarkable, this bounding through space did not feel
              disagreeable. But I think that in no very great distance more,
              consciousness as well as sensation would have been lost, and
              upon that I base my belief, improbable as it seems, that death
              by a fall from a great height is as painless an end as can be
              experienced.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              battering was very rough, yet no bones were broken. The most
              severe cuts were one of four inches long on the top of the
              head, and another of three inches on the right temple: this
              latter bled frightfully. There was a formidable-looking cut, of
              about the same size as the last, on the palm of the left hand,
              and every limb was grazed, or cut, more or less seriously. The
              tips of the ears were taken off, and a sharp rock cut a
              circular bit out of the side of the left boot, sock, and ankle,
              at one stroke. The loss of blood, although so great, did not
              seem to be permanently injurious. The only serious effect has
              been the reduction of a naturally retentive memory to a very
              common-place one; and although my recollections of more distant
              occurrences remain unshaken, the events of that particular day
              would be clean gone but for the few notes which were written
              down before the accident.</p>

            parabola, and finally splitting into fragments as it smote one of
            the rocky towers in front. Down the shattered fragments came like
            a kind of spray, slightly wide of us, but still near enough to
            compel a sharp look-out. Two or three such explosions occurred,
            but we chose the back fin of the mountain for our track, and from

              entered into this matter because much surprise has been
              expressed that Carrel was able to pass this place without any
              great difficulty in 1865, which turned back so strong a party
              in 1862. The cause of Professor Tyndall’s defeat was simply
              that his second guide (Walter) did not give aid to Bennen when
              it was required, and that the Carrels <span class=
              "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">would not act as
              guides after having been hired as porters</span></span>. J.-A.
              Carrel not only knew of the existence of this place before they
              came to it, but always believed in the possibility of passing
              it, and of ascending the mountain; and had he been leader to
              the party, I do not doubt that he might have taken Tyndall to
              the top. But when appealed to to assist Bennen (a Swiss, and
              the recognised leader of the party), was it likely that he (an
              Italian, a porter), who intended to be the first man up the
              mountain by a route which he regarded peculiarly his own, would
              render any aid?</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not so
              easy to understand how Dr. Tyndall and Bennen overlooked the
              existence of this cleft, for it is seen over several points of
              the compass, and particularly well from the southern side of
              the Théodule pass. Still more difficult is it to explain how
              the Professor came to consider that he was only a stone’s-throw
              from the summit; for, when he got to the end of <span class=

              Saussure appears to have taken mules from Breil, over the Val
              Tournanche glacier to the summit of the Théodule; and on a
              previous journey he did the same, also in the middle of August.
              He distinctly mentions (§ 2220) that the glacier was completely

              very bare of snow, and many crevasses are open. They are easily

              before we crossed the Breuiljoch in 1863, Mr. F. Morshead made
              a parallel pass to it. He crossed the ridge on the <span class=
              "tei tei-hi"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">western</span></span> side of the little
              peak, and followed a somewhat more difficult route than ours.
              In 1865 I wanted to use Mr. Morshead’s pass (see <a href=
              "#Pg235" class="tei tei-ref">p. 235</a>), but found that it was
              not possible to descend the Zermatt side; for, during the two
              years which had elapsed, the glacier had shrunk so much that it
              was completely severed from the summit of the pass, and we
              could not get down the rocks that were exposed.</p>

              admirable situation of Zermatt has been known for, at least,
              forty years, it is only within the last twenty or so that it
              has become an approved Alpine centre. Thirty years ago the
              Théodule pass, the Weissthor, and the Col d’Hérens, were, I
              believe, the only routes ever taken from Zermatt across the
              Pennine Alps. At the present time there are (inclusive of these
              passes and of the valley road) no less than twenty-six
              different ways in which a tourist may go from Zermatt. The
              summits of some of these cols are more than 14,000 feet above
              the level of the sea, and a good many of them cannot be
              recommended, either for ease, or as offering the shortest way
              from Zermatt to the valleys and villages to which they
              lead.</p>

              with a well-known comrade—J. Baptiste Bich, of Val
              Tournanche—to endeavour to make one. They went towards the
              glacier which descends from the Dent d’Erin to the south-east,
              and, on arriving at its base, ascended at first by some snow
              between it and the cliffs on its south, and afterwards took to
              the cliffs themselves. [This glacier they called the glacier of
              Mont Albert, after the local name of the peak which on Mr.
              Reilly’s map of the Valpelline is called <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“Les Jumeaux.”</span> On Mr. Reilly’s map the
              glacier is called <span class="tei tei-q">“Glacier
              d’Erin.”</span>] They ascended the rocks to a considerable
              height, and then struck across the glacier, towards the north,
              to a small <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=

              patch of rocks) that is nearly in the centre of the glacier.
              They passed above this, and between it and the great
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">séracs</span></span>. Afterwards their
              route led them towards the Dent d’Erin, and they arrived at the
              base of its final peak by mounting a <span class=
              "tei tei-hi"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">couloir</span></span> (gully filled with
              snow), and the rocks at the head of the glacier. They gained
              the summit of their pass at 1 <span class=
              "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">P.M.</span></span>,
              and, descending by the glacier of Zardesan, arrived at Prerayen
              at 6.30 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As their
              route joins that taken by Messrs. Hall, Grove, and Macdonald,
              on their ascent of the Dent d’Erin in 1863, it is evident that
              that mountain can be ascended from Breil. Carrel considers that
              the route taken by himself and his comrade Bich can be improved
              upon; and, if so, it is possible that the ascent of the Dent
              d’Erin can be made from Breil in less time than from Prerayen.
              Breil is very much to be preferred as a starting-point.</p>

            that which we adopted on the descent of the Col Dolent, namely,
            to let one man go in advance until he reaches some secure point.
            This one then detaches himself, the rope is drawn up, and another
            man is sent down to join him, and so on until the last. The last
            man still occupies the most difficult post, and should be the
            steadiest man; but he is not exposed to any risk from his
            comrades slipping, and they, of course, draw in the rope as he

              <span class="tei tei-q">“A fair walker,”</span> he said,

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Charles
              Hudson, Vicar of Skillington in Lincolnshire, was considered by
              the mountaineering fraternity to be the best amateur of his
              time. He was the organiser and leader of the party of
              Englishmen who ascended Mont Blanc by the Aig. du Goûter, and
              descended by the Grands Mulets route, without guides, in 1855.
              His long practice made him surefooted, and in that respect he
              was not greatly inferior to a born mountaineer. I remember him
              as a well-made man of middle height and age, neither stout nor
              thin, with face pleasant—though grave, and with quiet
              unassuming manners. Although an athletic man, he would have
              been overlooked in a crowd; and although he had done the
              greatest mountaineering feats which have been done, he was the
              last man to speak of his own doings. His friend Mr. Hadow was a
              young man of nineteen, who had the looks and manners of a
              greater age. He was a rapid walker, but 1865 was his first
              season in the Alps. Lord Francis Douglas was about the same age
              as Mr. Hadow. He had had the advantage of several seasons in
              the Alps. He was nimble as a deer, and was becoming an expert
              mountaineer. Just before our meeting he had ascended the Ober
              Gabelhorn (with old Peter Taugwalder and Jos. Viennin), and
              this gave me a high opinion of his powers; for I had examined
              that mountain all round, a few weeks before, and had declined
              its ascent on account of its apparent difficulty.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My personal
              acquaintance with Mr. Hudson was very slight—still I should
              have been content to have placed myself under his orders if he
              had chosen to claim the position to which he was entitled.
              Those who knew him will not be surprised to learn that, so far
              from doing this, he lost no opportunity of consulting the
              wishes and opinions of those around him. We deliberated
              together whenever there was occasion, and our authority was
              recognised by the others. Whatever responsibility there was
              devolved upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

              satisfaction that there was no difference of opinion between us
              as to what should be done, and that the most perfect harmony
              existed between all of us so long as we were together.</p>

            not, perhaps, have taken the same precautions. It is a noteworthy
            fact, that the lateral moraine of the left bank of the
            Furggengletscher is scarcely larger than that of the right bank,
            although the former receives all the débris that falls from the

            each other that we might one day arrive upon the top, and find
            ourselves cut off from the very highest point by a notch in the

              (afterwards) by turning over to the Z’Mutt, or north-western
              side. On the 18th he returned to Breil.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst we
              were upon the southern end of the summit-ridge, we paid some
              attention to the portion of the mountain which intervened
              between ourselves and the Italian guides. It seemed as if there
              would not be the least chance for them if they should attempt
              to storm the final peak directly from the end of the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“shoulder.”</span> In that direction
              cliffs fell sheer down from the summit, and we were unable to
              see beyond a certain distance. There remained the route about
              which Carrel and I had often talked, namely to ascend directly
              at first from the end of the <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“shoulder,”</span> and afterwards to swerve to the
              left—that is, to the Z’Mutt side—and to complete the ascent
              from the north-west. When we were upon the summit we laughed at
              this idea. The part of the mountain that I have described upon
              <a href="#Pg278" class="tei tei-ref">p. 278</a>, was not easy,
              although its inclination was moderate. If that slope were made
              only ten degrees steeper, its difficulty would be enormously
              increased. To double its inclination would be to make it
              impracticable. The slope at the southern end of the
              summit-ridge, falling towards the north-west, was <span class=
              "tei tei-hi"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">much</span></span> steeper than that over
              which we passed, and we ridiculed the idea that any person
              should attempt to ascend in that direction, when the northern
              route was so easy. Nevertheless, the summit was reached by that
              route by the undaunted Carrel. From knowing the final slope
              over which he passed, and from the account of Mr. F. C.
              Grove—who is the only traveller by whom it has been traversed—I
              do not hesitate to term the ascent of Carrel and Bich in 1865
              the most desperate piece of mountain-scrambling upon record. In
              1869 I asked Carrel if he had ever done anything more
              difficult. His reply was, <span class="tei tei-q">“Man cannot

              moment of the accident, Croz, Hadow, and Hudson, were all close
              together. Between Hudson and Lord F. Douglas the rope was all
              but taut, and the same between all the others, who were
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">above</span></span>. Croz was standing by
              the side of a rock which afforded good hold, and if he had been
              aware, or had suspected, that anything was about to occur, he
              might and would have gripped it, and would have prevented any
              mischief. He was taken totally by surprise. Mr. Hadow slipped
              off his feet on to his back, his feet struck Croz in the small
              of the back, and knocked him right over, head first. Croz’s axe
              was out of his reach, yet without it he managed to get his head
              uppermost before he disappeared from our sight. If it had been
              in his hand I have no doubt that he would have stopped himself
              and Mr. Hadow.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Hadow,
              at the moment of his slip, was not occupying a bad position. He
              could have moved either up or down, and could touch with his
              hand the rock of which I have spoken. Hudson was not so well
              placed, but he had liberty of motion. The rope was not taut
              from him to Hadow, and the two men fell ten or twelve feet
              before the jerk came upon him. Lord F. Douglas was not
              favourably placed, and could neither move up nor down. Old
              Peter was firmly planted, and stood just beneath a large rock
              which he hugged with both arms. I enter into these details to
              make it more apparent that the position occupied by the party
              at the moment of the accident was not by any means excessively
              trying. We were compelled to pass over the exact spot where the
              slip occurred, and we found—even with shaken nerves—that
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

              to pass. I have described the <span class=

              generally</span></span> as difficult, and it is so undoubtedly
              to most persons; but it must be distinctly understood that Mr.

              the only occasion upon which M. Clemenz (who presided over the
              inquiry) has failed to give up answers that he has promised. It
              is greatly to be regretted that he does not feel that the
              suppression of the truth is equally against the interests of
              travellers and of the guides. If the men are untrustworthy, the
              public should be warned of the fact; but if they are blameless,
              why allow them to remain under unmerited suspicion?</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Old Peter
              Taugwalder is a man who is labouring under an unjust
              accusation. Notwithstanding repeated denials, even his comrades
              and neighbours at Zermatt persist in asserting or insinuating
              that he <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">cut</span></span> the rope which led from
              him to Lord F. Douglas. In regard to this infamous charge, I
              say that he <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">could</span></span> not do so at the
              moment of the slip, and that the end of the rope in my
              possession shows that he did not do so beforehand. There
              remains, however, the suspicious fact that the rope which broke
              was the thinnest and weakest one that we had. It is suspicious,
              because it is unlikely that any of the four men in front would
              have selected an old and weak rope when there was abundance of
              new, and much stronger, rope to spare; and, on the other hand,
              because if Taugwalder thought that an accident was likely to
              happen, it was to his interest to have the weaker rope where it
              was placed.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I should
              rejoice to learn that his answers to the questions which were
              put to him were satisfactory. Not only was his act at the
              <a name="corr294" id="corr294" class=
              "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">critical</span>
              moment wonderful as a feat of strength, but it was admirable in
              its performance at the right time. I am told that he is now
              nearly incapable for work—not absolutely mad, but with
              intellect gone and almost crazy; which is not to be wondered
              at, whether we regard him as a man who contemplated a
              scoundrelly meanness, or as an injured man suffering under an
              unjust accusation.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
